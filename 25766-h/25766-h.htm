    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the 1880 edition of Men of the Day, under the heading <i>Astier-Réhu</i>,
      may be read the following notice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Astier, commonly called Astier-Réhu (Pierre Alexandre Léonard), Member of
      the Académie Française, was born in 1816 at Sauvagnat (Puy-de-Dôme). His
      parents belonged to the class of small farmers. He displayed from his
      earliest years a remarkable aptitude for the study of history. His
      education, begun at Riom and continued at Louis-le-Grand, where he was
      afterwards to re-appear as professor, was more sound than is now
      fashionable, and secured his admission to the Ecole Normale Supérieure,
      from which he went to the Chair of History at the Lycée of Mende. It was
      here that he wrote the Essay on Marcus Aurelius, crowned by the Académie
      Française. Called to Paris the following year by M. de Salvandy, the young
      and brilliant professor showed his sense of the discerning favour extended
      to him by publishing, in rapid succession, The Great Ministers of Louis
      XIV. (crowned by the Académie Française), Bonaparte and the Concordat
      (crowned by the Académie Française), and the admirable Introduction to the
      History of the House of Orleans, a magnificent prologue to the work which
      was to occupy twenty years of his life. This time the Académie, having no
      more crowns to offer him, gave him a seat among its members. He could
      scarcely be called a stranger there, having married Mlle. Rèhu, daughter
      of the lamented Paulin Réhu, the celebrated architect, member of the
      Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, and granddaughter of the
      highly respected Jean Réhu, the father of the Académie Française, the
      elegant translator of Ovid and author of the Letters to Urania, whose hale
      old age is the miracle of the Institute. By his friend and colleague M.
      Thiers Léonard Astier-Réhu was called to the post of Keeper of the
      Archives of Foreign Affairs. It is well known that, with a noble disregard
      of his interests, he resigned, some years later (1878), rather than that
      the impartial pen of history should stoop to the demands of our present
      rulers. But deprived of his beloved archives, the author has turned his
      leisure to good account. In two years he has given us the last three
      volumes of his history, and announces shortly New Lights on Galileo, based
      upon documents extremely curious and absolutely unpublished. All the works
      of Astier-Réhu may be had of Petit-Séquard, Bookseller to the Académie.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the publisher of this book of reference entrusts to each person
      concerned the task of telling his own story, no doubt can possibly be
      thrown upon the authenticity of these biographical notes. But why must it
      be asserted that Léonard Astier-Réhu resigned his post as Keeper of the
      Archives? Every one knows that he was dismissed, sent away with no more
      ceremony than a hackney-cabman, because of an imprudent phrase let slip by
      the historian of the House of Orleans, vol. v. p. 327: &lsquo;Then, as to-day,
      France, overwhelmed by the flood of demagogy, etc.&rsquo; Who can see the end of
      a metaphor? His salary of five hundred pounds a year, his rooms in the
      Quai d&rsquo;Orsay (with coals and gas) and, besides, that wonderful treasure of
      historic documents, which had supplied the sap of his books, all this had
      been carried away from him by this unlucky &lsquo;flood,&rsquo; all by his own flood!
      The poor man could not get over it. Even after the lapse of two years,
      regret for the ease and the honours of his office gnawed at his heart, and
      gnawed with a sharper tooth on certain dates, certain days of the month or
      the week, and above all on &lsquo;Teyssèdre&rsquo;s Wednesdays.&rsquo; Teyssèdre was the man
      who polished the floors. He came to the Astiers&rsquo; regularly every
      Wednesday. On the afternoon of that day Madame Astier was at home to her
      friends in her husband&rsquo;s study, this being the only presentable apartment
      of their third floor in the Rue de Beaune, the remains of a grand house,
      terribly inconvenient in spite of its magnificent ceiling. The disturbance
      caused to the illustrious historian by this &lsquo;Wednesday,&rsquo; recurring every
      week and interrupting his industrious and methodical labours, may easily
      be conceived. He had come to hate the rubber of floor, a man from his own
      country, with a face as yellow, close, and hard as his own cake of
      beeswax. He hated Teyssèdre, who, proud of coming from Riom, while
      &lsquo;Meuchieu Achtier came only from Chauvagnat,&rsquo; had no scruple in pushing
      about the heavy table covered with pamphlets, notes, and reports, and
      hunted the illustrious victim from room to room till he was driven to seek
      refuge in a kind of pigeon-hole over the study, where, though not a big
      man, he must sit for want of room to get up. This lumber-closet, which was
      furnished with an old damask chair, an aged card-table and a stand of
      drawers, looked out on the courtyard through the upper circle of the great
      window belonging to the room below. Through this opening, much resembling
      the low glass door of an orangery, the travailing historian might be seen
      from head to foot, miserably doubled up like Cardinal La Balue in his
      cage. It was here that he was sitting one morning with his eyes upon an
      ancient scrawl, having been already expelled from the lower room by the
      bang-bang-bang of Teyssèdre, when he heard the sound of the front door
      bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that you, Fage?&rsquo; asked the Academician in his deep and resonant bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, <i>Meuchieu Achtier</i>. It is the young gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On Wednesday mornings the polisher opened the door, because Corentine was
      dressing her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How&rsquo;s <i>The Master?</i>&rsquo; cried Paul Astier, hurrying by to his mother&rsquo;s
      room. The Academician did not answer. His son&rsquo;s habit of using ironically
      a title generally bestowed upon him as a compliment was always offensive
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;M. Fage is to be shown up as soon as he comes,&rsquo; he said, not addressing
      himself directly to the polisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, <i>Meuchieu Achtier</i>.&rsquo; And the bang-bang-bang began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good morning, mamma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Paul! Come in. Mind the folds, Corentine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Astier was putting on a skirt before the looking-glass. She was
      tall, slender, and still good-looking in spite of her worn features and
      her too delicate skin. She did not move, but held out to him a cheek with
      a velvet surface of powder. He touched it with his fair pointed beard. The
      son was as little demonstrative as the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will M. Paul stay to breakfast?&rsquo; asked Corentine. She was a stout
      countrywoman of an oily complexion, pitted with smallpox. She was sitting
      on the carpet like a shepherdess in the fields, and was about to repair,
      at the hem of the skirt, her mistress&rsquo;s old black dress. Her tone and her
      attitude showed the objectionable familiarity of the under-paid
      maid-of-all-work.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Paul would not stay to breakfast. He was expected elsewhere. He had
      his buggy below; he had only come to say a word to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your new English cart? Let me look,&rsquo; said Madame Astier. She went to the
      open window, and parted the Venetian blinds, on which the bright May
      sunlight lay in stripes, just far enough to see the neat little vehicle,
      shining with new leather and polished pinewood, and the servant in
      spotless livery standing at the horse&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am, how beautiful!&rsquo; murmured Coren-tine, who was also at the
      window. &lsquo;How nice M. Paul must look in it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother&rsquo;s face shone. But windows were opening opposite, and people
      were stopping before the equipage, which was creating quite a sensation at
      this end of the Rue de Beaune. Madame Astier sent away the servant, seated
      herself on the edge of a folding-chair, and finished mending her skirt for
      herself, while she waited for what her son had to say to her, not without
      a suspicion what it would be, though her attention seemed to be absorbed
      in her sewing. Paul Astier was equally silent. He leaned back in an
      arm-chair and played with an ivory fan, an old thing which he had known
      for his mother&rsquo;s ever since he was born. Seen thus, the likeness between
      them was striking; the same Creole skin, pink over a delicate duskiness,
      the same supple figure, the same impenetrable grey eye, and in both faces
      a slight defect hardly to be noticed; the finely-cut nose was a little out
      of line, giving an expression of slyness, of something not to be trusted.
      While each watched and waited for the other, the pause was filled by the
      distant brushing of Teyssèdre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather good, that,&rsquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother looked up. &lsquo;What is rather good?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised the fan and pointed, like an artist, at the bare arms and the
      line of the falling shoulders under the fine cambric bodice. She began to
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but look here.&rsquo; She pointed to her long neck, where the fine
      wrinkles marked her age. &lsquo;But after all,&rsquo;... you have the good looks, so
      what does it matter? Such was her thought, but she did not express it. A
      brilliant talker, perfectly trained in the fibs and commonplaces of
      society, a perfect adept in expression and suggestion, she was left
      without words for the only real feeling which she had ever experienced.
      And indeed she really was not one of those women who cannot make up their
      minds to grow old. Long before the hour of curfew&mdash;though indeed
      there had perhaps never been much fire in her to put out&mdash;all her
      coquetry, all her feminine eagerness to captivate and charm, all her
      aspirations towards fame or fashion or social success had been transferred
      to the account of her son, this tall, good-looking young fellow in the
      correct attire of the modern artist, with his slight beard and close-cut
      hair, who showed in mien and bearing that soldierly grace which our young
      men of the day get from their service as volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is your first floor let?&rsquo; asked the mother at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let! let! Not a sign of it! All the bills and advertisements no go! &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know what is the matter with them; but they don&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; as Védrine
      said at his private exhibition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed quietly, at an inward vision of Védrine among his enamels and
      his sculptures, calm, proud, and self-assured, wondering without anger at
      the non-appearance of the public. But Madame Astier did not laugh. That
      splendid first floor empty for the last two years! In the Rue Fortuny! A
      magnificent situation&mdash;a house in the style of Louis XII.&mdash;a
      house built by her son! Why, what did people want? The same people,
      doubtless, who did not go to Védrine. Biting off the thread with which she
      had been sewing, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it is worth taking, too!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite; but it would want money to keep it up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The people at the Crédit Foncier would not be satisfied. And the
      contractors were upon him&mdash;four hundred pounds for carpenter&rsquo;s work
      due at the end of the month, and he hadn&rsquo;t a penny of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother, who was putting on the bodice of her dress before the
      looking-glass, grew pale and saw that she did so. It was the shiver that
      you feel in a duel, when your adversary raises his pistol to take aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have had the money for the restorations at Mousseaux?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mousseaux! Long ago.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the Rosen tomb?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t get on. Védrine still at his statue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and why must you have Védrine? Your father warned you against him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I know. They can&rsquo;t bear him at the Institute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and walked about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know me, come. I am a practical man. If I took him and not some one
      else to do my statue, you may suppose that I had a reason.&rsquo; Then suddenly,
      turning to his mother:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You could not let me have four hundred pounds, I suppose?&rsquo; She had been
      waiting for this ever since he came in; he never came to see her for
      anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Four hundred pounds? How can you think&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; She said no more;
      but the pained expression of her mouth and eyes said clearly enough:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know that I have given you everything&mdash;that I am dressed in
      clothes fit for the rag-bag&mdash;that I have not bought a bonnet for
      three years&mdash;that Corentine washes my linen in the kitchen because I
      should blush to give such rubbish to the laundress; and you know also that
      my worst misery is to refuse what you ask. Then why do you ask?&rsquo; And this
      mute address of his mother&rsquo;s was so eloquent that Paul Astier answered it
      aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I was not thinking of your having it yourself. By Jove, if you
      had, it would be the better for me. But,&rsquo; he continued, in his cool, off
      hand way, &lsquo;there is <i>The Master</i> up there. Could you get it from him?
      You might. You know how to get hold of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is over. There is an end of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but, you know, he works; his books sell; you spend nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked round in the subdued light at the reduced state of the old
      furniture, the worn curtains, the threadbare carpet, nothing of later date
      than their marriage thirty years ago. Where was it then that all the money
      went?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; he began again, &lsquo;I wonder whether my venerable sire is in the
      habit of taking his fling?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an idea so monstrous, so inconceivable, that of Léonard Astier-Réhu
      &lsquo;taking his fling,&rsquo; that his wife could not help smiling in spite of
      herself. No, on that point she thought there was no need for uneasiness.
      &lsquo;Only, you know, he has turned suspicious and mysterious, and &ldquo;buries his
      hoard.&rdquo; We have gone too far with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke low, like conspirators, with their eyes upon the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And grandpapa,&rsquo; said Paul, but not in a tone of confidence, &lsquo;could you
      try him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grandpapa? You must be mad!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he knew well enough what old Réhu was. A touchy, selfish man all but a
      hundred years old, who would have seen them all die rather than deprive
      himself of a pinch of snuff or a single one of the pins that were always
      stuck on the lapels of his coat. Ah, poor child! He must be hard up indeed
      before he could think of his grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you would not like me to try &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;.&rsquo; She
      paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To try where?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the Rue de Courcelles. I might get something in advance for the tomb.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There? Good Heavens! You had better not!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to her imperiously, with pale lips and a disagreeable expression
      in his eye; then recovering his self-contained and fleeting tone, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble any more about it. It is only a crisis to be got through. I
      have had plenty before now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out to him his hat, which he was looking for. As he could get
      nothing from her, he would be off. To keep him a few minutes longer, she
      began talking of an important business which she had in hand&mdash;a
      marriage, which she had been asked to arrange.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the word <i>marriage</i> he started and looked at her askance: &lsquo;Who was
      it?&rsquo; She had promised to say nothing at present. But she could not refuse
      him. It was the Prince d&rsquo;Athis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is the lady?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her turn now to show him the side view of her crooked nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not know the lady. She is a foreigner with a fortune. If I succeed
      I might help you. I have made my terms in black and white.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, completely reassured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how does the Duchess take it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She knows nothing of it, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her <i>Sammy</i>,&rsquo; Her dear prince! And after fifteen years!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Astier&rsquo;s gesture expressed the utter carelessness of one woman for
      the feelings of another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What else could she expect at her age?&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what is her age?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was born in 1827. We are in 1880. You can do the sum. Just a year
      older than myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Duchess!&rsquo; cried Paul, stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother laughed as she said, &lsquo;Why, yes, you rude boy! What are you
      surprised at? I am sure you thought her twenty years younger. It&rsquo;s a fact,
      it seems, that the most experienced of you know nothing about women. Well,
      you see, the poor prince could not have her hanging on to him all his
      life. Besides, one of these days the old Duke will die, and then where
      would he be? Fancy him tied to that old woman!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Paul, &lsquo;so much for your dear friend!&rsquo; She fired at this. Her
      dear friend! The Duchess! A pretty friend! A woman who, with twenty-five
      thousand a year&mdash;intimate as she was with her, and well aware of
      their difficulties&mdash;had never so much as thought of helping them!
      What was the present of an occasional dress? Or the permission to choose a
      bonnet at her milliner&rsquo;s? Presents for use! There was no pleasure in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like grandpapa Réhu&rsquo;s on New Year&rsquo;s day,&rsquo; put in Paul assenting. &lsquo;An
      atlas, or a globe!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Antonia is, I really think, more stingy still. When we were at
      Mousseaux, in the middle of the fruit season, if <i>Sammy</i> was not
      there, do you remember the dry plums they gave us for dessert? There is
      plenty in the orchard and the kitchen garden, but everything is sent to
      market at Blois or Vendôme. It runs in her blood, you know. Her father,
      the Marshal, was famous for it at the Court of Louis Philippe; and it was
      something to be thought stingy at the Court of Louis Philippe! These great
      Corsican families are all alike; nothing but meanness and pretension! They
      will eat chestnuts, such as the pigs would not touch, off plate with their
      arms on it. And as for the Duchess&mdash;why, she makes her steward
      account to her in person! They take the meat up to her every morning; and
      every evening (this is from a person who knows), when she has gone to her
      grand bed with the lace, at that tender moment she balances her books!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Astier was nearly breathless. Her small voice grew sharp and
      shrill, like the cry of a sea-bird from the masthead. Meanwhile Paul,
      amused at first, had begun to listen impatiently, with his thoughts
      elsewhere. &lsquo;I am off,&rsquo; said he abruptly. &lsquo;I have a breakfast with some
      business people&mdash;very important.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An order?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not architect&rsquo;s business this time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She wanted him to satisfy her curiosity, but he went on, &lsquo;Not now; another
      time; it&rsquo;s not settled.&rsquo; And finally, as he gave his mother a little kiss,
      he whispered in her ear, &lsquo;All the same, do not forget my four hundred.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But for this grown-up son, who was a secret cause of division, the
      Astier-Réhu would have had a happy household, as the world, and in
      particular the Academic world, measures household happiness. After thirty
      years their mutual sentiments remained the same, kept beneath the snow at
      the temperature of what gardeners call a &lsquo;cold-bed.&rsquo; When, about &lsquo;50,
      Professor Astier, after brilliant successes at the Institute, sued for the
      hand of Mademoiselle Adelaide Réhu, who at that time lived with her
      grandfather at the Palais Mazarin, it was not the delicate and slender
      beauty of his betrothed, it was not the bloom of her &lsquo;Aurora&rsquo; face, which
      were the real attractions for him. Neither was it her fortune. For the
      parents of Mademoiselle Adelaide, who died suddenly of cholera, had left
      her but little; and the grandfather, a Creole from Martinique, an old beau
      of the time of the Directory, a gambler, a free liver, great in practical
      jokes and in duels, declared loudly and repeatedly that he should not add
      a penny to her slender portion.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, that which enticed the scion of Sauvagnat, who was far more ambitious
      than greedy, was the Académie. The two great courtyards which he had to
      cross to bring his daily offering of flowers, and the long solemn
      corridors into which at intervals there descended a dusty staircase, were
      for him rather the path of glory than of love. The Paulin Réhu of the
      Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, the Jean Réhu of the &lsquo;Letters to Urania,&rsquo; 
      the Institute complete with its lions and its cupola&mdash;this was the
      Mecca of his pilgrimage, and all this it was that he took to wife on his
      wedding day.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this not transient beauty he felt a passion proof against the tooth of
      time, a passion which took such hold of him that his permanent attitude
      towards his wife was that of those mortal husbands on whom, in the
      mythological age, the gods occasionally bestowed their daughters. Nor did
      he quit this respect when at the fourth ballot he had himself become a
      deity. As for Madame Astier, who had only accepted marriage as a means of
      escape from a hard and selfish grandfather in his anecdotage, it had not
      taken her long to find out how poor was the laborious peasant brain, how
      narrow the intelligence, concealed by the solemn manners of the Academic
      laureate and manufacturer of octavos, and by his voice with its ophicleide
      notes adapted to the sublimities of the lecture room. And yet when, by
      force of intrigue, bargaining, and begging, she had seated him at last in
      the Académie, she felt herself possessed by a certain veneration,
      forgetting that it was herself who had clothed him in that coat with the
      green palm leaves, in which his nothingness ceased to be visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dull concord of their partnership, where was neither joy, nor
      intimacy, nor communion of any kind, there was but one single note of
      natural human feeling, their child; and this note disturbed the harmony.
      In the first place the father was entirely disappointed of all that he
      wished for his son, that he should be distinguished by the University,
      entered for the general examinations, and finally pass through the Ecole
      Normale to a professorship. Alas! at school Paul took prizes for nothing
      but gymnastics and fencing, and distinguished himself chiefly by a wilful
      and obstinate perversity, which covered a practical turn of mind and a
      precocious understanding of the world. Careful of his dress and his
      appearance, he never went for a walk without the hope, of which he made no
      secret to his schoolfellows, of &lsquo;picking up a rich wife.&rsquo; Two or three
      times the father had been ready to punish this determined idleness after
      the rough method of Auvergne, but the mother was by to excuse and to
      protect. In vain Astier-Réhu scolded and snapped his jaw, a prominent
      feature which, in the days when he was a professor, had gained him the
      nickname of <i>Crocodilus</i>. In the last resort, he would threaten to
      pack his trunk and go back to his vineyard at Sauvagnat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Léonard, Léonard!&rsquo; Madame Astier would say with gentle mockery; and
      nothing further came of it. Once, however, he really came near to
      strapping his trunk in good earnest, when, after a three years&rsquo; course of
      architecture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paul refused to compete for the
      Prix de Rome. The father could scarcely speak for indignation. &lsquo;Wretched
      boy! It is the Prix de Rome! You cannot know; you do not understand. The
      Prix de Rome! Get that, and it means the Institute!&rsquo; Little the young man
      cared. What he wanted was wealth, and wealth the Institute does not
      bestow, as might be seen in his father, his grandfather, and old Réhu, his
      great-grandfather! To start in life, to get a business, a large business,
      an immediate income&mdash;this was what he wanted for his part, and not to
      wear a green coat with palms on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Léonard Astier was speechless. To hear such blasphemies uttered by his son
      and approved by his wife, a daughter of the house of Réhu! This time his
      trunk was really brought down from the box room; his old trunk, such as
      professors use in the provinces, with as much ironwork in the way of nails
      and hinges as might have sufficed for a church door, and high enough and
      deep enough to have held the enormous manuscript of &lsquo;Marcus Aurelius&rsquo; 
      together with all the dreams of glory and all the ambitious hopes of an
      historian on the high road to the Académie. It was in vain for Madame
      Astier to pinch her lips and say, &lsquo;Oh, Léonard, Léonard!&rsquo; Nothing would
      stop him till his trunk was packed. Two days it stood in the way in the
      middle of his study. Then it travelled to the ante-room; and there
      reposed, turned once and for ever into a wood-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at first, it must be said, Paul Astier did splendidly. Helped by his
      mother and her connection in good society, and further assisted by his own
      cleverness and personal charm, he soon got work which brought him into
      notice. The Duchess Padovani, wife of a former ambassador and minister,
      trusted him with the restoration of her much admired country house at
      Mousseaux-on-the-Loire, an ancient royal residence, long neglected, which
      he succeeded in restoring with a skill and ingenuity really amazing in an
      undistinguished scholar of the Beaux-Arts. Mousseaux got him the order for
      the new mansion of the Ambassador of the Porte; and finally the Princess
      of Rosen commissioned him to design the mausoleum of Prince Herbert of
      Rosen, who had come to a tragic end in the expedition of Christian of
      Illyria. The young man now thought himself sure of success. Astier the
      elder was induced by his wife to put down three thousand pounds out of his
      savings for the purchase of a site in the Rue Fortuny. Then Paul built
      himself a mansion&mdash;or rather, a wing to a mansion, which was itself
      arranged as a block of elegant &lsquo;rooms to let.&rsquo; He was a practical young
      fellow, and if he wanted a mansion, without which no artist is <i>chic</i>,
      he meant it to bring him an income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately houses to let are not always so easy to let, and the young
      architect&rsquo;s way of life, with two horses in his stable (one for harness,
      one for the saddle), his club, his visiting, his slow reimbursements, made
      it impossible for him to wait. Moreover, the elder Astier suddenly
      declared that he was not going to give any more; and all that the mother
      could attempt or say for her darling son failed to shake this irrevocable
      decision. Her will, which had hitherto swayed the establishment, was now
      resisted. Thenceforward there was a continual struggle. The mother used
      her ingenuity to make little dishonest profits on the household expenses,
      that she might never have to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to her son&rsquo;s requests. Léonard
      suspected her and, to protect himself, checked the accounts. In these
      humiliating conflicts the wife, who was the better bred, was the first to
      tire; and nothing less than the desperate situation of her beloved Paul
      would have induced her to make a fresh attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went slowly into the dining room. It was a long, melancholy room, ill
      lighted by tall, narrow windows, having in fact been used as a <i>table
      d&rsquo;hôte</i> for ecclesiastics until the Astiers took it. There she found
      her husband already at table, looking preoccupied and almost grumpy. In
      the ordinary way &lsquo;<i>the Master</i>&rsquo; came to his meals with a smiling
      serenity as regular as his appetite, and with teeth which, sound as a
      foxhound&rsquo;s, were not to be discouraged by stale bread or leathery meat, or
      by the miscellaneous disagreeables which are the everyday flavouring of
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s Teyssèdre&rsquo;s day,&rsquo; thought Madame Astier, as she took her seat,
      her best dress rustling as she did so. She was a little surprised at not
      receiving the compliment with which her husband never failed to welcome
      her &lsquo;Wednesday&rsquo; costume, shabby as it was. Reckoning that this bad temper
      would go off with the first mouthfuls, she waited before beginning her
      attack. But, though <i>the Master</i> went on eating, his ill humour
      visibly increased. Everything was wrong; the wine tasted of the cork; the
      balls of boiled beef were burnt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And all because your M. Fage kept you waiting this morning,&rsquo; cried
      Corentine angrily from the adjoining kitchen. She showed her shiny pitted
      face for a moment at the hatch in the wall through which, in the days of
      the <i>table d&rsquo;hôte</i>, they used to pass the dishes. She shut it with a
      bang; upon which Astier muttered, &lsquo;Really that girl&rsquo;s impudence&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
      He was in truth much annoyed that the name of Fage had been mentioned
      before his wife. And sure enough at any other moment Madame Astier would
      not have failed to say, &lsquo;Oh, Fage the bookbinder here again!&rsquo; and there
      would have followed a domestic scene; on all which Corentine reckoned when
      she threw in her artful speech. To-day, however, it was all-important that
      the master should not be irritated, but prepared by skilful stages for the
      intended petition. He was talked to, for instance, about the health of
      Loisillon, the perpetual secretary of the Académie, who, it seemed, was
      getting worse and worse. Loisillon&rsquo;s post and his rooms in the Institute
      were to come to Léonard Astier as a compensation for the office which he
      had lost; and though he was really attached to his dying colleague, still
      the prospect of a good salary, an airy and comfortable residence, and
      other advantages had its attractions. He was perhaps ashamed to think of
      the death in this light, but in the privacy of his household he did so
      without blinking. But to-day even that did not bring a smile. &lsquo;Poor M.
      Loisillon!&rsquo; said Madame Astier&rsquo;s thin voice; &lsquo;he begins to be uncertain
      about his words. La vaux was telling us yesterday at the Duchess&rsquo;s, he can
      only say &ldquo;a cu-curiosity, a cu-curiosity,&rdquo; and,&rsquo; she added, compressing
      her lips and drawing up her long neck, &lsquo;he is on the Dictionary
      Committee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Astier-Réhu did not move an eyebrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not a bad story,&rsquo; said he, clapping his jaw with a magisterial air.
      &lsquo;But, as I have said somewhere in my history, in France the provisional is
      the only thing that lasts. Loisillon has been dying any time this ten
      years. He&rsquo;ll see every one of us buried yet&mdash;every one of us,&rsquo; he
      repeated angrily, pulling at his dry bread. It was clear that Teyssèdre
      had put him into a very bad temper indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Astier went to another subject, the special meeting of all the five
      Académies, which was to take place within a few days, and to be honoured
      by the presence of the Grand Duke Leopold of Finland. It so happened that
      Astier-Réhu, being director for the coming quarter, was to preside at the
      meeting and to deliver the opening speech, in which his Highness was to
      receive a compliment. Skilfully questioned about this speech, which he was
      already planning, Léonard described it in outline. It was to be a crushing
      attack upon the modern school of literature&mdash;a sound thrashing
      administered in public to these pretenders, these dunces. And at this his
      eyes, big with his heavy meal, lighted up his square face, and the blood
      rose under his thick bushy eyebrows. They were still coal-black, and
      contrasted strangely with the white circle of his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the way,&rsquo; said he suddenly, &lsquo;what about my uniform coat? Has it been
      seen to? The last time I wore it, at Montribot&rsquo;s funeral&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But do not women think of everything? Madame Astier had seen to the coat
      that very morning. The silk of the palm leaves was getting shabby; the
      lining was all to pieces. It was very old. Oh, dear, when did he wear it
      first? Why, it was as long ago&mdash;as long ago&mdash;as when he was
      admitted! The twelfth of October, eighteen-sixty-six! He had better order
      a new one for the Meeting. The five Académies, a Royal Highness, and all
      Paris! Such an audience was worth a new coat. Léonard protested, not
      energetically, on the ground of expense. With a new coat he would want a
      new waistcoat; knee-breeches were not worn now, but a new waistcoat would
      be indispensable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, you really must!&rsquo; She continued to press him. If they did not
      take care they would make themselves ridiculous with their economy. There
      were too many shabby old things about them. The furniture of her room, for
      instance! It made her feel ashamed when a friend came in, and for a sum
      comparatively trifling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ouais! quelque sot,&rsquo; muttered Astier-Réhu, who liked to quote his
      classics. The furrow in his forehead deepened, and under it, as under the
      bar of a shutter, his countenance, which had been open for a minute, shut
      up. Many a time had he supplied the means to pay a milliner&rsquo;s bill, or a
      dressmaker&rsquo;s, or to re-paper the walls, and after all no account had been
      settled and no purchase made. All the money had gone to that Charybdis in
      the Rue Fortuny. He had had enough of it, and was not going to be caught
      again. He rounded his back, fixed his eyes upon the huge slice of Auvergne
      cheese which filled his plate, and said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Astier was familiar with this dogged silence. This attitude of
      passive resistance, dead as a ball of cotton, was always put on when money
      was mentioned. But this time she was resolved to make him answer. &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; 
      she said, &lsquo;I see you rolling up, Master Hedgehog. I know the meaning of
      that. &ldquo;Nothing to be got! nothing to be got! No, no, no!&rdquo; Eh?&rsquo; The back
      grew rounder and rounder. &lsquo;But you can find money for M. Fage.&rsquo; Astier
      started, sat up, and looked uneasily at his wife. Money for M. Fage? What
      did she mean?&rsquo; Why, of course,&rsquo; she went on, delighted to have forced the
      barrier of his silence, &lsquo;of course it takes money to do all that binding.
      And what&rsquo;s the good of it, I should like to know, for all those old
      scraps?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt relieved; evidently she knew nothing; it was only a chance shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the term &lsquo;old scraps&rsquo; went to his heart: unique autograph documents,
      signed letters of Richelieu, Colbert, Newton, Galileo, Pascal, marvels
      bought for an old song, and worth a fortune. &lsquo;Yes, madam, a fortune.&rsquo; He
      grew excited, and began to quote figures, the offers that had been made
      him. Bos, the famous Bos of the Rue de l&rsquo;Abbaye (and he knew his business
      if any one did), Bos had offered him eight hundred pounds merely for three
      specimens from his collection&mdash;three letters from Charles the Fifth
      to François Rabelais. Old scraps indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Astier listened in utter amazement. She was well aware that for the
      last two or three years he had been collecting old manuscripts. He used
      sometimes to speak to her of his finds, and she listened in a wandering
      absent-minded way, as a woman does listen to a man&rsquo;s voice when she has
      heard it for thirty years. But this was beyond her conception. Eight
      hundred pounds for three letters! And why did he not take it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He burst out like an explosion of dynamite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sell my Charles the Fifths! Never! I would see you all without bread and
      begging from door to door before I would touch them&mdash;understand
      that!&rsquo; He struck the table. His face was very pale, and his lips thrust
      out This fierce maniac was an Astier-Réhu whom his wife did not know. In
      the sudden glow of a passion human beings do thus take aspects unknown to
      those who know them best The next minute the Academician was quite calm,
      again, and was explaining, not without embarrassment, that these documents
      were indispensable to him as an author, especially now that he could not
      command the Records of the Foreign Office. To sell these materials would
      be to give up writing. On the contrary, he hoped to make additions to
      them. Then, with a touch of bitterness and affection, which betrayed the
      whole depth of the father&rsquo;s disappointment, he said, &lsquo;After my time, my
      fine gentleman of a son may sell them if he chooses; and since all he
      wants is to be rich, I will answer for it that he will be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; but meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This &lsquo;meanwhile&rsquo; was said in a little flute-like voice so cruelly natural
      and quiet that Léonard, unable to control his jealousy of this son who
      left him no place in his wife&rsquo;s heart, retorted with a solemn snap of the
      jaw, &lsquo;Meanwhile, madam, others can do as I do. I have no mansion, I keep
      no horses and no English cart. The tramway does for my going and coming,
      and I am content to live on a third floor over an <i>entresol</i>, where I
      am exposed to Teyssèdre. I work night and day, I pile up volume after
      volume, two and three octavos in a year. I am on two committees of the
      Académie; I never miss a meeting; I never miss a funeral; and even in the
      summer I never accept an invitation to the country, lest I should miss a
      single tally. I hope my son, when he is sixty-five, may be as
      indefatigable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long since he had spoken of Paul, and never had he spoken so
      severely. The mother was struck by his tone, and in her look, as she
      glanced sidelong, almost wickedly, at her husband, there was a shade of
      respect, which had not been there before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a ring,&rsquo; said Léonard eagerly, rising as he spoke, and flinging
      his table napkin upon the back of his chair. &lsquo;That must be my man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s some one for you, ma&rsquo;am; they are beginning early to-day,&rsquo; said
      Corentine, as, with her kitchen-maid&rsquo;s fingers wiped hastily on her apron,
      she laid a card on the edge of the table. Madame Astier looked at it. &lsquo;The
      Vicomte de Freydet.&rsquo; A gleam came into her eyes. But her delight was not
      perceptible in the calm tone in which she said, &lsquo;So M. de Freydet is in
      Paris?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, about his book.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless me! His book! I have not even cut it. What is it about?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried over the last mouth fuls, and washed the tips of her white
      fingers in her glass while her husband in an absent-minded way gave her
      some idea of the new volume. &lsquo;God in Nature,&rsquo; a philosophic poem, entered
      for the Boisseau prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I do hope he will get it. He must, he must. They are so nice, he and
      his sister, and he is so good to the poor paralysed creature. Do you think
      he will?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Astier would not commit himself. He could not promise, but he would
      certainly recommend Freydet, who seemed to him to be really improving. &lsquo;If
      he asks you for my personal opinion, it is this: there is still a little
      too much for my taste, but much less than in his other books. You may tell
      him that his old master is pleased.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Too much of what? Less of what? It must be supposed that Madame Astier
      knew, for she sought no explanation, but left the table and passed, quite
      happy, into her drawing room&mdash;as the study must be considered for the
      day. Astier, more and more absorbed in thought, lingered for some minutes,
      breaking up with his knife what remained in his plate of the Auvergne
      cheese; then, being disturbed in his meditations by Corentine, who,
      without heeding him, was rapidly clearing the table, he rose stiffly and
      went up, by a little staircase like a cat-ladder, to his attic, where he
      took up his magnifying glass and resumed the examination of the old
      manuscript upon which he had been busy since the morning.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      SITTING straight, with the reins well held up in the most correct fashion,
      Paul Astier drove his two-wheeled cart at a stiff pace to the scene of his
      mysterious breakfast &lsquo;with some business people.&rsquo; &lsquo;Tclk! tclk!&rsquo; Past the
      Pont Royal, past the quays, past the Place de la Concorde. The road was so
      smooth, the day so fine, that as terraces, trees, and fountains went by,
      it would have needed but a little imagination on his part to believe
      himself carried away on the wings of Fortune. But the young man was no
      visionary, and as he bowled along he examined the new leather and straps,
      and put questions about the hay-merchant to his groom, a young fellow
      perched at his side looking as cool and as sharp as a stable terrier. The
      hay-merchant, it seemed, was as bad as the rest of them, and grumbled
      about supplying the fodder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, does he?&rsquo; said Paul absently; his mind had already passed to another
      subject. His mother&rsquo;s revelations ran in his head. Fifty-three years old!
      The beautiful Duchess Antonia, whose neck and shoulders were the despair
      of Paris! Utterly incredible! &lsquo;Tclk! tclk!&rsquo; He pictured her at Mousseaux
      last summer, rising earlier than any of her guests, wandering with her
      dogs in the park while the dew was still on the ground, with loosened hair
      and blooming lips; she did not look made up, not a bit. Fifty-three years
      old? Impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tclk, tclk! Hi! Hi!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s a nasty corner between the Rond Pont and the
      Avenue d&rsquo;Antin.&mdash;All the same, it was a low trick they were playing
      her, to find a wife for the Prince. For let his mother say what she would,
      the Duchess and her drawing-room had been a fine thing for them all.
      Perhaps his father might never have been in the Académie but for her; he
      himself owed her all his commissions. Then there was the succession to
      Loisillon&rsquo;s place and the prospect of the fine rooms under the cupola&mdash;well,
      there was nothing like a woman for flinging you over. Not that men were
      any better; the Prince d&rsquo;Athis, for instance. To think what the Duchess
      had done for him! When they met he was a ruined and penniless rip; now
      what was he? High in the diplomatic service, member of the Académie des
      Sciences Morales et Politiques, on account of a book not a word of which
      he had written himself, &lsquo;The Mission of Woman in the World&rsquo;. And while the
      Duchess was busily at work to fit him with an Embassy, he was only waiting
      to be gazetted before taking French leave and playing off this dirty trick
      on her, after fifteen years of uninterrupted happiness. &lsquo;The mission of
      woman in the world!&rsquo; Well, the Prince understood what the mission of woman
      was. The next thing was to better the lesson. &lsquo;Tclk! tclk! Gate, please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul&rsquo;s soliloquy was over, and his cart drew up before a mansion in the
      Rue de Courcelles. The double gates were rolled, back slowly and heavily
      as if accomplishing a task to which they had long been unused.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this house lived the Princess Colette de Rosen, who had shut herself up
      in the complete seclusion of mourning since the sad occurrence which had
      made her a widow at twenty-six. The daily papers recorded the details of
      the young widow&rsquo;s sensational despair: how the fair hair was cut off close
      and thrown into the coffin; how her room was decorated as for a lying in
      state; how she took her meals alone with two places laid, while on the
      table in the anteroom lay as usual the Prince&rsquo;s walking stick, hat, and
      gloves, as though he were at home and just going out. But one detail had
      not been mentioned, and that was the devoted affection and truly maternal
      care which Madame Astier showed for the &lsquo;poor little woman&rsquo; in these
      distressing circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their friendship had begun some years ago, when a prize for an historical
      work had been adjudged to the Prince de Rosen by the Académie, &lsquo;on the
      report of Astier-Réhu.&rsquo; Differences of age and social position had however
      kept them apart until the Princess&rsquo;s mourning removed the barrier. When
      the widow&rsquo;s door was solemnly closed against society, Madame Astier alone
      escaped the interdict. Madame Astier was the only person allowed to cross
      the threshold of the mansion, or rather the convent, inhabited by the poor
      weeping Carmelite with her shaven head and robe of black; Madame Astier
      was the only person admitted to hear the mass sung twice a week at St.
      Philip&rsquo;s for the repose of Herbert&rsquo;s soul; and it was she who heard the
      letters which Colette wrote every evening to her absent husband, relating
      her life and the way she spent her days. All mourning, however rigid,
      involves attention to material details which are degrading to grief but
      demanded by society. Liveries must be ordered, trappings provided for
      horses and carriages, and the heartbroken mourner must face the
      hypocritical sympathy of the tradesman. All these duties were discharged
      by Madame Astier with never-failing patience. She undertook the heavy task
      of managing the household, which the tear-laden eyes of its fair mistress
      could no longer supervise, and so spared the young widow all that could
      disturb her despair, or disarrange her hours for praying, weeping, writing
      &lsquo;to him,&rsquo; and carrying armfuls of exotic flowers to the cemetery of Père
      Lachaise, where Paul Astier was superintending the erection of a gigantic
      mausoleum in commemorative stone brought at the express wish of the
      Princess from the scene of the tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately the quarrying of this stone and its conveyance from Illyria,
      the difficulties of carving granite, and the endless plans and varying
      fancies of the widow, to whom nothing seemed sufficiently huge and
      magnificent to suit her dead hero, had brought about many hitches and
      delays. So it happened that in May 1880, two years and more after the
      catastrophe and the commencement of the work, the monument was still
      unfinished. Two years is a long time to maintain the constant paroxysms of
      an ostentatious grief, each sufficient to discharge the whole. The
      mourning was still observed as rigidly as ever, the house was still closed
      and silent as a cave. But in the place of the living statue weeping and
      praying in the furthest recesses of the crypt was now a pretty young woman
      whose hair was growing again, instinct with life in every curl and wave of
      its soft luxuriance. The reappearance of this fair hair gave a touch of
      lightness, almost of brightness, to the widow&rsquo;s mourning, which seemed now
      no more than a caprice of fashion. In the movements and tones of the
      Princess was perceptible the stirring of spring; she had the air of relief
      and repose noticeable in young widows in the second period of their
      mourning. It is a delightful position. For the first time after the
      restraints of girlhood and the restraints of marriage, a woman enjoys the
      sweets of liberty and undisputed possession of herself; she is freed from
      contact with the coarser nature of man, and above all from the fear of
      maternity, the haunting terror of the young wife of the present day. In
      the case of the Princess Colette the natural development of uncontrollable
      grief into perfect peacefulness was emphasised by the paraphernalia of
      inconsolable widowhood with which she was still surrounded. It was not
      hypocrisy; but how could she give orders, without raising a smile on the
      servants&rsquo; faces, to remove the hat always waiting in the ante-room, the
      walking stick conspicuously handy, the place at table always laid for the
      absent husband; how could she say, &lsquo;The Prince will not dine to-night&rsquo;?
      But the mystic correspondence &lsquo;with Herbert in heaven&rsquo; had begun to fall
      off, growing less frequent every day, till it ended in a calmly written
      journal which caused considerable, though unexpressed, amusement to
      Colette&rsquo;s discerning friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was that Madame Astier had a plan. The idea had sprung up in her
      practical little mind one Tuesday night at the Théâtre Français, when the
      Prince d&rsquo;Athis had said to her confidentially in a low voice: &lsquo;Oh, my dear
      Adelaide, what a chain to drag! I am bored to death.&rsquo; She at once planned
      to marry him to the Princess. It was a new game to play, crossing the old
      game, but not less subtle and fascinating. She had not now to hold forth
      upon the eternal nature of vows, or to hunt up in Joubert or other worthy
      philosophers such mottoes as the following, which the Princess had written
      out at the beginning of her wedding book: &lsquo;A woman can be wife and widow
      with honour but once.&rsquo; She no longer went into raptures over the manly
      beauty of the young hero, whose portrait, full length and half length,
      profile and three quarters, in marble and on canvas, met you in every part
      of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her system now to bring him gradually and dexterously down. &lsquo;Do you
      not think, dear,&rsquo; she would say, &lsquo;that these portraits of the Prince make
      his jaw too heavy? Of course I know the lower part of his face was rather
      pronounced, a little too massive.&rsquo; And so she administered a series of
      little poisonous stabs, with an indescribable skill and gentleness,
      drawing back when she went too far, and watching for Colette&rsquo;s smile at
      some criticism a little sharper than the rest. Working in this way she at
      last brought Colette to admit that Herbert had always had a touch of the
      boor; his manners were scarcely up to his rank; he had not, for instance,
      the distinguished air of the Prince d&rsquo;Athis, &lsquo;whom we met a few Sundays
      ago on the steps of St. Philip&rsquo;s. If you should fancy him, dear, he is
      looking for a wife.&rsquo; This last remark was thrown out as a jest; but
      presently Madame Astier recurred to it and put it more definitely. Well,
      why should the Princess not marry him? It would be most suitable; the
      Prince had a good name, a diplomatic position of some importance; the
      marriage would involve no alteration of the Princess&rsquo;s coronet or title&mdash;a
      practical convenience not to be overlooked. &lsquo;And, indeed, if I am to tell
      you the truth, dear, the Prince entertains towards you an affection
      which&rsquo;... &amp;c. &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word &lsquo;affection&rsquo; at first hurt the Princess&rsquo;s feelings, but she soon
      grew used to hear it. They met the Prince d&rsquo;Athis at church, then in great
      privacy at Madame Astier&rsquo;s in the Rue de Beaune, and Colette soon admitted
      that he was the only man who might have induced her to abandon her
      widowhood. But then poor dear Herbert had loved her so devotedly&mdash;she
      had been his all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really,&rsquo; said Madame Astier with the quiet smile of a person who knows.
      Then followed allusions, hints, and all the devices by which one woman
      poisons the mind of another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, my dear, there is no such thing in the world. A man of good breeding&mdash;a
      gentleman&mdash;will take care, for the sake of peace, not to give his
      wife pain or distress. But&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you mean that Herbert&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was no better than the rest of them.&rsquo; The Princess, with an indignant
      protest, burst into tears; painless, passionless tears, such as ease a
      woman, and leave her as fresh as a lawn after a shower. But still she did
      not give way, to the great annoyance of Madame Astier, who had no
      conception of the real cause of her obduracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was that frequent meetings to criticise the scheme of the
      mausoleum, much touching of hands and mingling of locks over the plans and
      sketches of cells and sepulchral figures, had created between Paul and
      Colette a fellow feeling which had gradually grown more and more tender,
      until one day Paul Astier detected in Colette&rsquo;s eyes as she looked at him
      an expression that almost confessed her liking. There rose before him as a
      possibility the miraculous vision of Colette de Rosen bringing him her
      million as a marriage gift. That might be in a short time, after a
      preliminary trial of patience, a regularly conducted beleaguering of the
      fortress. In the first place it was most important to-betray no hint to
      &lsquo;mamma,&rsquo; who, though very cunning and subtle, was likely to fail through
      excess of zeal, especially when the interests of her Paul were at stake.
      She would spoil all the chances in her eagerness to hasten the successful
      issue. So Paul concealed his plans from Madame Astier, in entire ignorance
      that she was running a countermine in the same line as his. He acted on
      his own account with great deliberation. The Princess was attracted by his
      youth and fashion, his brightness and his witty irony, from which he
      carefully took the venom. He knew that women, like children and the mob,
      and all impulsive and untutored beings, hate a tone of sarcasm, which puts
      them out, and which they perceive by instinct to be hostile to the dreams
      of enthusiasm and romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this spring morning it was with feelings of more confidence than usual
      that young Astier reached the house. This was the first time that he had
      been asked to breakfast at the Rosen mansion; the reason alleged was a
      visit which they were to make together to the cemetery, in order to
      inspect the works on the spot. With an unexpressed understanding they had
      fixed on a Wednesday, the day when Madame Astier was &lsquo;at home,&rsquo; so as not
      to have her as a third in the party. With this thought in his mind the
      young man, self-controlled as he was, let fall as he crossed the threshold
      a careless glance which took in the large courtyard and magnificent
      offices almost as if he were entering on the possession of them. His
      spirits fell as he passed through the ante-room, where the footmen and
      lacqueys in deep mourning were dozing on their seats. They seemed to be
      keeping a funeral vigil round the hat of the defunct, a magnificent grey
      hat, which proclaimed the arrival of spring as well as the determination
      with which his memory was kept up by the Princess. Paul was much annoyed
      by it; it was like meeting a rival. He did not realise the difficulty
      which prevented Colette from escaping the self-forged fetters of her
      custom. He was wondering angrily whether she would expect him to breakfast
      in company with <i>him</i>, when the footman who relieved him of his
      walking stick and hat informed him that the Princess would receive him in
      the small drawing-room. He was shown at once into the rotunda with its
      glass roof, a bower of exotic plants, and was completely reassured by the
      sight of a little table with places laid for two, the arrangement of which
      Madame de Rosen was herself superintending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A fancy of mine,&rsquo; she said, pointing to the table, &lsquo;when I saw how fine
      it was. It will be almost like the country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had spent the night considering how she could avoid sitting down with
      this handsome young man in the presence of <i>his</i> knife and fork, and,
      not knowing what to say to the servants, had devised the plan of
      abandoning the situation and ordering breakfast, as a sudden whim, &lsquo;in the
      conservatory.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether the &lsquo;business&rsquo; breakfast promised well. The <i>Romany blanc</i>
      lay to keep cool in the rocky basin of the fountain, amidst ferns and
      water plants, and the sun shone on the pieces of spar and on the bright
      smooth green of the outspread leaves. The two young people sat opposite
      one another, their knees almost touching: he quite self-possessed, his
      light eyes cold and fiery; she all pink and white, her new growth of hair,
      like a delicate wavy plumage, showing without any artificial arrangement
      the shape of her little head. And while they talked on indifferent topics,
      both concealing their real thoughts, young Astier exulted each time that
      the silent servants opened the door of the deserted dining-room, when he
      saw in the distance the napkin of the departed, left for the first time
      cheerless and alone.

      My dear Sister,&mdash;I am going to give you a precise account of the way
      I spend my time in Paris. I shall write every evening, and send you the
      budget twice a week, as long as I stay here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I arrived this morning, Monday, and took up my quarters as usual in
      my quiet little hotel in the Rue Servandoni, where the only sounds of the
      great city which reach me are the bells of Saint Sulpice, and the
      continual noise from a neighbouring forge, a sound of the rhythmical
      beating of iron, which I love because it reminds me of our village. I
      rushed off at once to my publisher. &lsquo;Well, when do we come out?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your book? Why, it came out a week ago.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Come out, indeed, and gone in too&mdash;gone into the depths of that grim
      establishment of Manivet&rsquo;s, which never ceases to pant and to reek with
      the labour of giving birth to a new volume. This Monday, as it happened,
      they were just sending out a great novel by Herscher, called <i>Satyra</i>.
      The copies struck off&mdash;how many hundreds of thousands of them I don&rsquo;t
      know&mdash;were lying in stacks and heaps right up to the very top of the
      establishment. You can fancy the preoccupation of the staff, and the lost
      bewildered look of worthy Manivet himself, when I mentioned my poor little
      volume of verse, and talked of my chances for the Boisseau prize. I asked
      for a few copies to leave with the members of the committee of award, and
      made my escape through <i>streets</i>&mdash;literally streets&mdash;of <i>Satyra</i>,
      piled up to the ceiling. When I got into my cab, I looked at my volume and
      turned over the pages. I was quite pleased with the solemn effect of the
      title, &lsquo;God in Nature.&rsquo; The capitals are perhaps a trifle thin, when you
      come to look at them, not quite as black and impressive to the eye as they
      might be. But it does not matter. Your pretty name, &lsquo;Germaine,&rsquo; in the
      dedication will bring us luck. I left a couple of copies at the Astiers&rsquo; 
      in the Rue de Beaune. You know they no longer occupy their rooms at the
      Foreign Office. But Madame Astier has still her &lsquo;Wednesdays.&rsquo; So of course
      I wait till Wednesday to hear what my old master thinks of the book; and
      off I went to the Institute.
    </p>
    <p>
      There again I found them as busy as a steam factory. Really the industry
      of this big city is marvellous, especially to people like us, who spend
      all the year in the peace of the open country. Found Picheral&mdash;you
      remember Picheral, the polite gentleman in the secretary&rsquo;s office, who got
      you such a good place three years ago, when I received my prize&mdash;well,
      I found Picheral and his clerks in the midst of a wild hubbub of voices,
      shouting out names and addresses from one desk to another, and surrounded
      on all sides by tickets of every kind, blue, yellow, and green, for the
      platform, for the outer circle, for the orchestra, Entrance A, Entrance B,
      &amp;c. They were in the middle of sending out the invitations for the
      great annual meeting, which is to be honoured this year by the presence of
      a Royal Highness on his travels, the Grand Duke Leopold. &lsquo;Very sorry, my
      lord&rsquo;&mdash;Picheral always says &lsquo;my lord,&rsquo; having learnt it, no doubt,
      from Chateaubriand&mdash;&rsquo; but I must ask you to wait.&rsquo; &lsquo;Certainly, M.
      Picheral, certainly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Picheral is an amusing old gentleman, very courtly. He reminds me of
      Bonicar and our lessons in deportment in the covered gallery at
      grandmamma&rsquo;s house at Jallanges. He is as touchy, too, when crossed, as
      the old dancing master used to be. I wish you had heard him talk to the
      Comte de Bretigny, the ex-minister, one of the grandees of the Académie,
      who came in, while I was waiting, to rectify a mistake about the number of
      his tallies. I must tell you that the tally attesting attendance is worth
      five shillings, the old crown-piece. There are forty Academicians, which
      makes two hundred shillings per meeting, to be divided among those
      present; so, you see, the fewer they are, the more money each gets.
      Payment is made once a month in crown-pieces, kept in stout paper bags,
      each with its little reckoning pinned on to it, like a washing bill.
      Bretigny had not his complete number of tallies; and it was the most
      amusing sight to see this man of enormous wealth, director of Heaven knows
      how many companies, come there in his carriage to claim his ten shillings.
      He only got five, which sum, after a long dispute, Picheral tossed to him
      with as little respect as to a porter. But the &lsquo;deity&rsquo; pocketed them with
      inexpressible joy; there is nothing like money won by the sweat of your
      brow. For, my dear Germaine, you must not imagine that there is any idling
      in the Académie. Every year there are fresh bequests, new prizes
      instituted; that means more books to read, more reports to engross, to say
      nothing of the dictionary and the orations. &lsquo;Leave your book at their
      houses, but do not go in,&rsquo; said Picheral, when he heard I was competing
      for the prize. &lsquo;The extra work, which people are always putting on the
      members, makes them anything but gracious to a candidate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I certainly have not forgotten the way Ripault-Babin and Laniboire
      received me, when I called on them about my last candidature. Of course,
      when the candidate is a pretty woman, it is another story. Laniboire
      becomes jocose, and Ripault-Babin, still gallant in spite of his eighty
      years, offers the fair canvasser a lozenge, and says in his quavering
      voice, &lsquo;Touch it with your lips, and I will finish it.&rsquo; So they told me in
      the secretary&rsquo;s office, where the deities are discussed with a pleasing
      frankness. &lsquo;You are in for the Boisseau prize. Let me see; you have for
      awarders two Dukes, three Mouldies, and two Players.&rsquo; Such, in the office,
      is the familiar classification of the Académie Française! &lsquo;Duke&rsquo; is the
      name applied to all members of the nobility and episcopacy; Mouldies&rsquo; 
      includes the professors and the learned men generally; while a &lsquo;Player&rsquo; 
      denotes a lawyer, dramatic author, journalist, or novelist.
    </p>
    <p>
      After ascertaining the addresses of my Dukes, Mouldies, and Players, I
      gave one of my &lsquo;author&rsquo;s copies&rsquo; to the friendly M. Picheral, and, for
      form&rsquo;s sake, left another for poor M. Loisillon, the Permanent Secretary,
      who is said to be all but dead. Then I set to work to distribute the
      remaining copies all over Paris. The weather was glorious. As I passed
      through the Bois de Boulogne on my way back from the house of
      Ripault-Babin (which reminded me of the lozenges), the place was sweet
      with may and violets. I almost fancied myself at home again on one of
      those first days of early spring when the air is fresh and the sun hot;
      and I was inclined to give up everything and come back to you at
      Jallanges. Dined on the boulevard alone and gloomy, and then spent the
      rest of my evening at the Comédie Française, where they were playing
      Desminières&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>Le Dernier Frontin</i>.&rsquo; Desminières is one of the
      awarders of the Boisseau prize, so I shall tell no one but you how his
      verses bored me. The heat and gas gave me a headache. The actors played as
      if Louis XIV. had been listening; and while they spouted alexandrines,
      suggestive of the unrolling of a mummy&rsquo;s bands, I was still haunted by the
      scent of the hawthorn at Jallanges, and repeated to myself the pretty
      lines of Du Bellay, a fellow-countryman, or a neighbour at least:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     More than your marbles hard I love the tender slate,
        Than Tiber more the Loire, and France than Rome,
        Mine own dear hills than Palatinus&rsquo; state,
     More than the salt sea breeze the fragrantair of home.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Walked about the town all the morning, stopping in
      front of the booksellers&rsquo; shops to look for my book in the windows. <i>Satyra,
      Satyra, Satyra! Satyra</i> and nothing else to be seen everywhere, with a
      paper slip round it, &lsquo;Just out.&rsquo; Here and there, but very seldom, there
      would be a poor miserable <i>God in Nature</i> tucked away out of sight.
      When no one was looking I put it on the top of the heap, well in view; but
      people did not stop. One man did, though, in the Boulevard des Italiens, a
      negro, a very intelligent-looking fellow. He turned over the pages for
      five minutes, and then went away without buying the book. I should have
      liked to present it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfasted in the corner of an English eating-house, and read the papers.
      Not a word about me, not even an advertisement. Manivet is so careless,
      very likely he has not so much as sent the orders, though he declared he
      had. Besides, there are so many new books. Paris is deluged with them. But
      for all that it is depressing to think that verses, which ran like fire
      through one&rsquo;s fingers, which seemed, in the feverish delight of writing
      them, beautiful enough to fill the world with brightness, are more lost
      now that they are gone into circulation, than when they were but a
      confused murmuring in the brain of their author. It reminds one of a
      ball-dress. When it is tried on in the sympathetic family circle, it is
      expected to outshine and eclipse every dress in the room; but under the
      blaze of the gas it is lost in the crowd. Well, Herscher is a lucky
      fellow. He is read and understood. I met ladies carrying snugly under
      their arms the little yellow volume just issued. Alas, for us poor poets!
      It is all very well for us to rank ourselves above and beyond the crowd.
      It is for the crowd, after all, that we write. When Robinson Crusoe was on
      his desert island, cut off from all the world and without so much as the
      hope of seeing a sail on the horizon, would he have written verses, even
      if he had been a poetic genius? Thought about this a great deal as I
      tramped through the Champs Elysées, lost, like my book, in an unregarding
      stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was coming back to my hotel, pretty glum, as you may imagine, when on
      the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay, just in front of the grass-grown ruin of the Cour des
      Comptes, I knocked against a big fellow, strolling along in a brown study.
      &lsquo;Hullo, Freydet!&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Hullo, Védrine!&rsquo; said I. You&rsquo;ll remember my
      friend Védrine who, when he was working at Mousseaux, came with his sweet
      young wife to spend an afternoon at Clos-Jallanges. He is not a bit
      altered, except that he is a trifle grey at the temples. He held by the
      hand the fine boy with the beaming eyes, whom you used to admire. His head
      was erect, his movements slow and eloquent, his whole carriage that of a
      superior being. A little way behind was Madame Védrine pushing a
      perambulator, in which was a laughing little girl, born since their visit
      to Touraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That makes three for her, counting me,&rsquo; said Védrine, with a wave of his
      hand towards his wife; and the look of Madame when her eye rests on her
      husband really does express the tender satisfaction of motherhood; she is
      like a Flemish Madonna contemplating her Divine Child. Talked a long time,
      leaning against the parapet of the quay; it did me good to be with these
      honest folk. That is a man, anyhow, who cares nothing whatever for
      success, and the public, and the prizes! With his connections (he is
      cousin to Loisillon and to the Baron d&rsquo;Huchenard), if he chose&mdash;if he
      just put a little water into his strong wine&mdash;he might have orders,
      and get the Biennial Prize, and be in the Institute in no time. But
      nothing tempts him, not even fame. &lsquo;Fame,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I have had a taste of
      it. I know what it is. When a man&rsquo;s smoking, he sometimes gets his cigar
      by the wrong end. Well, that&rsquo;s fame: just a cigar with the hot end and ash
      in your mouth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Védrine,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if you work neither for fame nor for money&mdash;&mdash;
      yes, yes; I know you despise it; but, that being so, I say, why do you
      take so much trouble?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For myself and my personal satisfaction. It&rsquo;s the desire for creation and
      self-expression.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly here is a man who would have gone on with his work in the desert
      island. He is a true artist, ever in quest of a new type, and in the
      intervals of his labour endeavours by change of material and change of
      conditions to satisfy his craving for a fresh revelation. He has made
      pottery, enamels, mosaics, the fine mosaics so much admired in the
      guard-room at Mousscaux. When the thing is done, the difficulty overcome,
      he goes on to something else. At the present moment his great idea is to
      try painting; and the moment he has finished his warrior, a great bronze
      figure for the Rosen tomb, he intends, as he says, &lsquo;to put himself to
      oil.&rsquo; His wife always gives her approval, and rides behind him on each of
      his hobbies. The right wife for an artist taciturn, admiring, saving the
      grown-up boy from all that might spoil his dream or catch his feet as he
      goes star-gazing along. She is the sort of woman dear Germaine, to make a
      man want to be married. If I knew another such, I should certainly bring
      her to Clos-Jallanges, and I am sure you would love her. But do not be
      alarmed. There are not many of them; and we shall go on to the end, living
      just by our two selves, as we do now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we parted we fixed another meeting for Thursday, not at their house
      at Neuilly, but at the studio on the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay, where the whole family
      spend the day together. This studio would seem to be the strangest place.
      It is in a corner of the old Cour des Comptes. He has got permission to do
      his work there, in the midst of wild vegetation and mouldering heaps of
      stone. As I went away I turned to watch them walking along the quay,
      father, mother, and children, all enveloped in the calm light of the
      setting sun, which made a halo round them like a Holy Family. Strung
      together a few lines on the subject in the evening at my hotel; but I am
      put out by having neighbours, and do not like to spout. I want my large
      study at Jallanges, with its three windows looking out oh the river and
      the sloping vineyards.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now we come to <i>Wednesday</i>, the great day and the great event! I
      will tell you the story in full. I confess that I had been looking forward
      to my call on the Astiers with much trepidation, which increased to-day as
      I went up the broad moist steps of the staircase in the Rue de Beaune.
      What was I going to hear said about my book? Would my old master have had
      time to glance at it? His opinion means for me so very much. He inspires
      me still with the same awe as when I was in his class, and in his presence
      I shall always feel myself a schoolboy. His unerring and impartial
      judgment must be that of the awarders of the prize. So you may guess the
      tortures of impatience which I underwent in the master&rsquo;s large study,
      which he gives up to his wife for her reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      It&rsquo;s sadly different from the room at the Foreign Office. The table at
      which he writes is pushed away into a recess behind a great screen covered
      in old tapestry, which also hides part of the bookshelves. Opposite, in
      the place of honour, is a portrait of Madame Astier in her young days,
      wonderfully like her son, and also like old Réhu, whose acquaintance I
      have just had the honour of making. The portrait has a somewhat depressing
      air of elegance, cold and polished, like the large uncarpeted room itself,
      with its sombre curtains and its outlook on a still more sombre courtyard.
      But in comes Madame Astier, and her friendly greeting brightens all the
      surroundings. What is there in the air of Paris which preserves the beauty
      of a woman&rsquo;s face beyond the natural term, like a pastel under its glass?
      The delicate blonde with her keen eyes looked to me three years younger
      than when I saw her last. She began by asking after you, and how you were,
      dearest, showing great interest in our domestic life. Then suddenly she
      said: &lsquo;But your book, let us talk about your book. How splendid! You kept
      me reading all night.&rsquo; And she showered upon me well-chosen words of
      praise, quoted two or three lines with great appropriateness, and assured
      me that my old master was delighted; he had begged her to tell me so, in
      case he should not be able to tear himself from his documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red as you know I always am, I must have turned as scarlet as after a hunt
      dinner. But my joy soon passed away when I heard what the poor woman was
      led on into confiding to me about their embarrassments. They have lost
      money; then came Astier&rsquo;s dismissal; now the master works night and day at
      his historical books, which take so long to construct and cost so much to
      produce, and then are not bought by the public. Then they have to help old
      Réhu, the grandfather, who has nothing but his fees for attendance at the
      Académie; and at his age, ninety-eight, you may imagine the care and
      indulgence necessary. Paul is a good son, hardworking, and on the road to
      success, but of course the initial expenses of his profession are
      tremendous. So Madame Astier conceals their narrow means from him as well
      as from her husband. Poor dear man! I heard his heavy even step overhead
      while his wife was stammering out, with trembling lips and hesitating,
      reluctant words, a request that if I could&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, the adorable woman! I could have kissed the hem of her dress!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, my dear sister, you will understand the telegram you must have
      received a little while ago, and who the £400 were for that I asked for by
      return of post. I suppose you sent to Gobineau at once. The only reason I
      did not telegraph direct to him is that, as we &lsquo;go shares&rsquo; in everything,
      our freaks of liberality ought, like the rest, to be common to both. But
      it is terrible, is it not, to think of the misery concealed under these
      brilliant and showy Parisian exteriors?
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes after she had made these distressing disclosures people
      arrived and the room was full; Madame Astier was conversing with a
      complete self-possession and an appearance of happiness in voice and
      manner which made my flesh creep. Madame Loisillon was there, the wife of
      the Permanent Secretary. She would be much better employed in looking
      after her invalid than in boring society with the charms of their
      delightful suite, the most comfortable in the Institute, &lsquo;with three rooms
      more than it had in Villemain&rsquo;s time.&rsquo; She must have told us this ten
      times, in the pompous voice of an auctioneer, and in the hearing of a
      friend living uncomfortably in rooms lately used for a <i>table d&rsquo;hôte!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      No fear of such bad taste in Madame Ancelin, a name often to be seen in
      the Society papers. A good fat round lady, with regular features and high
      complexion, piping out epigrams, which she picks up and carries round: a
      friendly creature, it must be allowed. She too had sat up all night
      reading me. I begin to think it is the regular phrase. She begged me to
      come to her house whenever I liked. It is one of the three recognised
      meeting-places of the Académie. Picheral would say that Madame Ancelin,
      mad on the theatre, welcomes more especially the &lsquo;Players,&rsquo; Madame Astier
      the &lsquo;Mouldies,&rsquo; while the Duchess Padovani monopolises the &lsquo;Dukes,&rsquo; the
      aristocracy of the Institute. But really these three haunts of fame and
      intrigue communicate one with another, for on Wednesday in the Rue de
      Beaune I saw a whole procession of deities of every description. There was
      Danjou the writer of plays, Rousse, Boissier, Dumas, de Brétigny, Baron
      Huchenard of the Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, and the Prince d&rsquo;Athis of
      the Sciences Morales et Politiques. There is a fourth circle in process of
      formation, collected round Madame Eviza, a Jewess with full cheeks and
      long narrow eyes, who flirts with the whole Institute and sports its
      colours; she has green embroideries on the waistcoat of her spring
      costume, and a little bonnet trimmed with wings <i>à la</i> Mercury. She
      carries her flirtations a little too far. I heard her say to Danjou, whom
      she was asking to come and see her, &lsquo;The attractions of Madame Ancelin&rsquo;s
      house are for the palate, those of mine for the heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I require both lodging and board,&rsquo; was the cold reply of Danjou. Danjou,
      I believe, covers the heart of a cynic under his hard impenetrable mask
      and his black stiff thatch, like a shepherd of Latium. Madame Eviza is a
      fine talker, and is mistress of considerable information; I heard her
      quoting to the old Baron Huchenard whole sentences from his &lsquo;Cave Man,&rsquo; 
      and discussing Shelley with a boyish magazine writer, neat and solemn,
      with a pointed chin resting on the top of a high collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was young it was the fashion to begin with verse-writing, whatever
      was to follow, whether prose, business, or the bar. Nowadays people begin
      with literary criticism, generally a study on Shelley. Madame Astier
      introduced me to this young gentleman, whose views carry weight in the
      literary world; but my moustaches and the colour of my skin, as brown as
      that of a sapper-and-miner, probably failed to please him. We spoke only a
      few words, while I watched the performance of the candidates and their
      wives or relatives, who had come to show themselves and to see how the
      ground lay. Ripault-Babin is very old, and Loisillon cannot last much
      longer; and around these seats, which must soon be vacant, rages a war of
      angry looks and poisoned words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dalzon the novelist, your favourite, was there; he has a kindly, open,
      intellectual face, as you would expect from his books. But you would have
      been sorry to see him cringing and sniggering before a nobody like
      Brétigny, who has never done anything, but occupies in the Academic the
      seat reserved for the man of the world, as in the country we keep a place
      for the poor man in our Twelfth Night festivities. And not only did he
      court Brétigny, but every Academician who came in. There he was, listening
      to old Rehu&rsquo;s stories, laughing at Danjou&rsquo;s smallest jokes with the
      &lsquo;counterfeited glee&rsquo; with which at Louis-le-Grand we rewarded what Védrine
      used to call &lsquo;usher&rsquo;s wit.&rsquo; All this to bring his twelve votes of last
      year up to the required majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jean Réhu looked in at his granddaughter&rsquo;s for a few minutes,
      wonderfully fresh and erect, well buttoned up in a long frock coat. He has
      a little shrivelled face, looking as if it had been in the fire, and a
      short cottony beard, like moss on an old stone. His eyes are bright and
      his memory marvellous, but he is deaf, and this depresses him and drives
      him into long soliloquies about his interesting personal recollections,
      To-day he told us about the household of the Empress Joséphine at
      Malmaison; his &lsquo;compatriote,&rsquo; he calls her, both being Creoles from
      Martinique. He described her, in her muslins and cashmere shawls, smelling
      of musk so strongly as to take one&rsquo;s breath away, and surrounded with
      flowers from the colonies. Even in war time these flowers, by the
      gallantry of the enemy, were allowed to pass the lines of their fleet. He
      also talked of David&rsquo;s studio, as it was under the Consulate, and did us
      the painter, rating and scolding his pupils with his mouth all awry and
      the remains of his dinner in his cheek. After each extract from the long
      roll of his experience, the patriarch shakes his head solemnly, gazes into
      space, and says in his firm tones, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a thing that I have seen.&rsquo; It
      is his signature, as it were, put at the bottom of the picture to prove it
      genuine. I ought to say that, with the exception of Dalzon, who pretended
      to be drinking in his words, I was the only person in the room who
      attended to the old man&rsquo;s tales. They seemed to me much more worth hearing
      than the stories of a certain Lavaux, a journalist, or librarian, or
      something&mdash;a dreadful retailer of gossip, whatever else he may be.
      The moment he came in there was a general cry, &lsquo;Ah, here&rsquo;s Lavaux!&rsquo; and a
      circle was formed round him at once, all laughing and enjoying themselves.
      Even the frowning &lsquo;deities&rsquo; revel in his anecdotes. He has a
      smooth-shaven, quasi-clerical face and goggle eyes. He prefaces all his
      tales and witticisms with such remarks as &lsquo;I was saying to De Broglie,&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;Dumas told me the other day,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I have it from the Duchess herself,&rsquo; 
      backing himself up with the biggest names and drawing his instances from
      all quarters. He is a pet of the ladies, whom he posts up in all the
      intrigues of the Académie and the Foreign Office, the world of letters and
      the world of fashion. He is very intimate with Danjou, and a constant
      companion of the Prince d&rsquo;Athis, with whom he came in. Dalion and the
      young critic of Shelley he patronises; and indeed he exercises a power and
      authority quite inexplicable to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the medley of stories which he produced from his inexhaustible chops&mdash;most
      of them were riddles to a simple rustic like myself&mdash;one only struck
      me as amusing. It was the mishap which occurred to a young Count Adriani,
      of the Papal Guard. He was going through Paris, in attendance upon a
      reverend personage, to take a cardinal&rsquo;s hat and cap to some one or other,
      and the story is that he left the insignia at the house of some fair lady
      whom he met with as he left the train, and of whom he knew neither the
      name nor the address, being, poor young man! a stranger in Paris. So he
      had to write off to the Papal Court for new specimens of the
      ecclesiastical headgear to replace the first, which the lady must find
      entirely superfluous. The best part of the story is that the little Count
      Adriani is the Nuncio&rsquo;s own nephew, and that at the Duchess&rsquo;s last party&mdash;she
      is called &lsquo;the Duchess&rsquo; in Academic circles just as she is at Mousseaux&mdash;he
      told his adventure quite naively in his broken French. Lavaux imitates it
      wonderfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the laughter and the exclamations, &lsquo;Charming! Ah, what a
      man Lavaux is!&rsquo; etc., I asked Madame Ancelin, who was sitting near me, who
      Lavaux was, and what he did. The good lady was amazed. &lsquo;Lavaux? You don&rsquo;t
      know him? He is the Duchess&rsquo;s zebra.&rsquo; Thereupon she departed in pursuit of
      Danjou, and left me much the wiser! Really Parisian society is a most
      extraordinary thing; its vocabulary alters every season. Zebra&mdash;a
      zebra&mdash;what can it possibly mean? But I began to see that I was
      staying much too long, and that my old master was not going to appear; it
      was time I went. I made my way through the chairs to say good-bye to my
      hostess, and as I passed saw Mademoiselle Moser whimpering before
      Brétigny&rsquo;s white waistcoat. Poor Moser became a candidate ten years ago,
      and now has lost all hopes. So he goes nowhere himself, but sends his
      daughter, a lady of a certain age, not at all pretty, who plays the part
      of Antigone, climbs up to the top floors, makes herself general messenger
      and drudge to the Academicians and their wives, corrects proofs, nurses
      the rheumatic, and spends her forlorn maidenhood in running after the
      Academic chair which her father will never get. Dressed quietly in black,
      with an unbecoming bonnet, she stood in the doorway; and near her was
      Dalzon, very much excited, between two members of the Académie who looked
      judicial. He was protesting violently and with a choking voice. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not
      true, it&rsquo;s a shame, I never wrote it!&rsquo; Here was a mystery; and Madame
      Astier, who might have enlightened me, was herself engaged in close
      confabulation with Lavaux and the Prince d&rsquo;Athis. You must have seen the
      Prince d&rsquo;Athis driving about Mousseaux with the Duchess. &lsquo;Sammy,&rsquo; as he is
      called, is a long, thin, bald man, with stooping shoulders, a crinkled
      face as white as wax, and a black beard reaching half down his chest, as
      if his hair, falling from his head, had lodged upon his chin. He never
      speaks, and when he looks at you seems shocked at your daring to breathe
      the same air as he. He is high in the service, has a close, mysterious,
      English air which reminds you that he is Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s great-nephew,
      and is in high repute at the Institute and on the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay. He is said
      to be the only French diplomatist whom Bismarck never dared to look in the
      face. It is supposed that he will very shortly have one of the great
      Embassies. Then what will become of the Duchess? To leave Paris and follow
      him would be a serious thing for a leader of society. And then abroad the
      world might refuse to accept their equivocal relations, which here are
      looked upon almost as marriage, in consideration of the propriety of their
      conduct and their respect for appearances, and considering also the sad
      state of the Duke, half paralysed and twenty-years older than his wife,
      who is also his niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince, was no doubt discussing these grave matters with Lavaux and
      Madame Astier when I drew near. A man just arrived in any society, no
      matter where, soon finds how much he is &lsquo;out of it,&rsquo; He understands
      neither the phrases current nor the thoughts, and is a nuisance. I was
      just leaving when that kind Madame Astier called me back, saying, &lsquo;Will
      you not go up and see him? He will be so glad.&rsquo; So I went up a narrow
      staircase in the wall to see my old master. I heard his loud voice from
      the end of the passage, &lsquo;Is that you, Fage?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Freydet! Take care; keep your head down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in fact impossible to stand upright under the sloping roof. What a
      different place from the Foreign Office, where I last saw him, in a lofty
      gallery lined with portfolios.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A kennel, is it not?&rsquo; said the worthy man with a smile; &lsquo;but if you knew
      what treasures I have here,&rsquo;&mdash;and he waved his hand towards a large
      set of pigeonholes containing at least 10,000 important MS. documents,
      collected by him during the last few years. &lsquo;There is history in those
      drawers,&rsquo; he went on, growing more animated and playing with his
      magnifying glass; &lsquo;history new and authentic, let them say what they
      will.&rsquo; But in spite of his words he seemed to me gloomy and uncomfortable.
      He has been treated very badly. First came that cruel dismissal; and now,
      as he has continued to publish historical works based on new documents,
      people say that he has plundered from the Bourbon papers. This calumny was
      started in the Institute, and is traced to Baron Huchenard, who calls his
      collection of MSS. &lsquo;the first in France,&rsquo; and hates to be outdone by that
      of Astier. He tries to revenge himself by treacherous criticisms,
      launched, like an assegai, from the bush. &lsquo;Even my letters of Charles V.,&rsquo; 
      said Astier, &lsquo;even those they want now to prove false. And on what ground
      if you please? For a mere trifling error, &ldquo;Maître Rabelais&rdquo; instead of
      &ldquo;Frère Rabelais.&rdquo; As if an emperor&rsquo;s pen never made a slip! It&rsquo;s
      dishonest, that&rsquo;s what it is!&rsquo; And, seeing that I shared his indignation,
      my good old master grasped me by both hands and said, &lsquo;But there! enough
      of these slanders. Madame Astier told you, I suppose, about your book?
      There is still a little too much for my taste; but I am pleased with it on
      the whole.&rsquo; What there is &lsquo;too much&rsquo; of in my poetry is what he calls &lsquo;the
      weed&rsquo; of the fancy. At school he was always at it, plucking it out, and
      rooting it up. Now, dear Germaine, attend. I give you the last part of our
      conversation, word for word.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I.</i> Do you think, sir, that I have any chance of the Boisseau prize?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>M. A.</i> After such a book as that, my dear boy, it is not a prize you
      deserve, but a seat. Loisillon is hard hit; Ripault cannot last much
      longer. Don&rsquo;t move; leave it to me; henceforward I look upon you as a
      candidate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know what I said in reply. I was so confused that I feel still as
      if I were dreaming. Me, me, in the Académie Française! Take good care of
      yourself, dearest, and get your naughty legs well again; for you must come
      to Paris on the great occasion, and see your brother, with his sword at
      his side and his green coat embroidered with palms, take his place among
      all the greatest men of France! Why, it makes me dizzy now! So I send you
      a kiss, and am off to bed.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                Your affectionate brother,

                           ABEL DE FREYDET.
</pre>
    <p>
      You may imagine that among all these doings I have quite forgotten the
      seeds, matting, shrubs, and all the rest of my purchases. But I will see
      about them soon, as I shall stay here some time. Astier-Réhu advised me to
      say nothing, but to go about in Academic society. To show myself and be
      seen is the great point.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trust them, my dear Freydet. I know that trick; it&rsquo;s the recruiting
      trick. The fact is, these people feel that their day is past, and that
      under their cupola they are beginning to get mouldy. The Académie is a
      taste that is going out, an ambition no longer in fashion. Its success is
      only apparent. And indeed for the last few years the distinguished company
      has given up waiting at home for custom, and comes down into the street to
      tout. Everywhere, in society, in the studios, at the publishers&rsquo;, in the
      greenroom, in every literary or artistic centre, you will find the
      Recruiting-Academician, smiling on young budding talent. &ldquo;The Académie has
      its eye on you, my young friend.&rdquo; If a man has got some reputation, and
      has just written his third or fourth book, like you, then the invitation
      takes a more direct form. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget us, my dear fellow; now&rsquo;s your
      time.&rdquo; Or perhaps, brusquely, with a friendly scolding, &ldquo;Well, so you
      don&rsquo;t mean to be one of us.&rdquo; When it&rsquo;s a man in society who is to be
      caught a translator of Ariosto or a writer of amateur plays, there is a
      gentler and more insinuating way of playing off the trick. And if our
      fashionable writer protests that he is not a gun of sufficient calibre,
      the Recruiting-Academidan brings out the regular phrase, that &ldquo;the
      Académie is a club.&rdquo; Lord bless us, how useful that phrase has been! &ldquo;The
      Académie is a club, and its admission is not only for the work, but the
      worker.&rdquo; Meantime the Recruiting-Academician is welcomed everywhere, made
      much of, asked to dinner and other entertainments. He becomes a parasite,
      fawned upon by those whose hopes he arouses&mdash;and is careful to
      maintain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this point kind-hearted Freydet protested indignantly. Never would
      his old master lend himself to such base uses. Védrine shrugged his
      shoulders: &lsquo;Why, the worst of the lot is the recruiter who is sincere and
      disinterested. He believes in the Académie; his whole life is centred in
      the Académie; and when he says to you, &ldquo;If you only knew the joy of it,&rdquo;
       with a smack of the tongue like a man eating a ripe peach, he is saying
      what he really means, and so his bait is the more alluring and dangerous.
      But when once the hook has been swallowed and struck, then the Academician
      takes no more notice of the victim, but leaves him to struggle and dangle
      at the end of the line. You are an angler; well, when you have taken a
      fine perch or a big pike, and you drag it along behind your boat, what do
      you call that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drowning your fish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so. Well, look at Moser! Does he not look like a drowned fish? He
      has been carried along in tow for these ten years. And there&rsquo;s De Salèle,
      and Guérineau, and I don&rsquo;t know how many others, who have even given up
      struggling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But still people do get into the Académie sooner or later.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not those once taken in tow. And suppose a man does succeed, where&rsquo;s the
      good? What does it bring you? Money? Not as much as your hay-crop. Fame?
      Yes, a hole-and-corner fame within a space no bigger than your hat. It
      would be something if it gave talent, but those who have talent lose it
      when once they get inside and are chilled by the air of the place. The
      Académie is a club, you know; so there is a tone that must be adopted, and
      things which must be left unsaid, or watered down. There&rsquo;s an end to
      originality, an end to bold neck-or-nothing strokes. The liveliest spirits
      never move for fear of tearing their green coats. It is like putting
      children into their Sunday clothes and saying &ldquo;Amuse yourselves, my dears,
      but don&rsquo;t get dirty.&rdquo; And they do amuse themselves, I can tell you. Of
      course, they have the adulation of the Academical taverns, and their fair
      hostesses. But what a bore it is! I speak from experience, for I have let
      myself be dragged there occasionally. I can say with old Réhu, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
      thing I have seen.&rdquo; Silly pretentious women have favoured me with
      ill-digested scraps from magazine articles, coming out of their little
      beaks like the written remarks of characters in a comic paper. I have
      heard fat, good natured Madame Ancelin, a woman as stupid as anything,
      cackle with admiration at the epigrams of Danjou, regular stage
      manufacture, about as natural as the curling of his wig.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a shock for Freydet: Danjou, the shepherd of Latium, had a wig!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A half-wig, what they call a <i>breton</i>. At Madame Astier&rsquo;s,&rsquo; he went
      on, &lsquo;I have gone through lectures on ethnology enough to kill a
      hippopotamus; and at the table of the Duchess, the severe and haughty
      Duchess, I have seen that old monkey Laniboire, seated in the place of
      honour, do and say things for which, if he had not been a &ldquo;deity,&rdquo; he
      would have been turned out of the house, with a good-bye in her Grace&rsquo;s
      characteristic style. And the joke is, that it was she who got him into
      the Académie. She has seen that very Laniboire at her feet, begging
      humbly, piteously, importunately, to get himself elected, &ldquo;Elect him,&rdquo; she
      said to my cousin Loisillon, &ldquo;elect him, do; and then I shall be rid of
      him.&rdquo; And now she looks up to him as a god; he is always next her at
      table; and her contempt has changed into an abject admiration. It is like
      a savage, falling down and quaking before the idol he has carved. I know
      what Academic society is, with all its foolish, ludicrous, mean little
      intrigues. You want to get into it! What for, I should like to know? You
      have the happiest life in the world. Even I, who am not set upon anything,
      was near envying you, when I saw you with your sister at Clos-Jallanges: a
      perfect house on a hill-side, airy rooms, chimney-corners big enough to
      get into, oakwoods, cornfields, vineyards, river; the life of a country
      gentleman, as it is painted in the novels of Tolstoi; fishing and
      shooting, a pleasant library, a neighbourhood not too dull, the peasants
      reasonably honest; and to prevent you from growing callous in the midst of
      such unbroken satisfaction, your companion, suffering and smiling, full of
      life and keenness, poor thing, in her arm-chair, delighted to listen, when
      you came in from a ride and read her a good sonnet, genuine poetry, fresh
      from nature, which you had pencilled on your saddle, or lying flat in the
      grass, as we are now&mdash;only without this horrible din of waggons and
      trumpets.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Védrine stopped perforce. Some heavy drays, loaded with iron, and shaking
      ground and houses as they went by, a piercing alarum from the neighbouring
      barracks, the harsh screech of a steam-tug&rsquo;s whistle, an organ, and the
      bells of Sainte-Clotilde, all united at the moment, as from time to time
      the noises of a great town will do, in a thundering <i>tutti</i>; and the
      outrageous babel, close to the ear, contrasted strangely with the natural
      field of grass and weed, overshadowed by tall trees, in which the two old
      classmates were enjoying their smoke and their familiar chat.

    </div>
    <p>
      It was at the corner of the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay and the Rue de Bellechasse, on
      the ruined terrace of the old Cour des Comptes, now occupied by sweet wild
      plants, like a clearing in the forest at the coming of spring. Clumps of
      lilac past the flowering and dense thickets of plane and maple grew all
      along the balustrades, which were loaded with ivy and clematis: and within
      this verdant screen the pigeons lighted, the bees wandered, and under a
      beam of yellow light might be seen the calm and handsome profile of Madame
      Védrine, nursing her youngest, while the eldest threw stones at the
      numerous cats, grey, black, yellow, and tabby, which might be called the
      tigers of this Parisian jungle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And as we are talking of your poetry, you will wish me to speak my mind,
      won&rsquo;t you, old boy? Well, I have only just looked into your last book, but
      it has not that smell of bluebells and thyme that I found in the others.
      Your &ldquo;God in Nature&rdquo; has rather a flavour of the Academic bay; and I am
      much afraid you have made a sacrifice of your &ldquo;woodnotes wild,&rdquo; you know,
      and thrown them, by way of pass-money, into the mouth of <i>Crocodilus</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This nickname &lsquo;Crocodilus,&rsquo; turning up at the bottom of Védrine&rsquo;s
      schoolboy recollections, amused them for a moment. They pictured once more
      Astier-Réhu at his desk, with streaming brow, his cap well on the back of
      his head, and a yard of red ribbon relieved against the black of his gown,
      emphasising with the solemn movements of his wide sleeves the well-worn
      joke from Racine or Molière, or his own rounded periods in the style of
      Vic&rsquo;t-d&rsquo;Azir, whose seat in the Académie he eventually filled. Then
      Freydet, vexed with himself for laughing at his old master, began to
      praise his work as an historian. What a mass of original documents he had
      brought out of their dust!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in that,&rsquo; retorted Védrine with unqualified contempt. In
      his view, the most interesting documents in hands of a fool had no more
      meaning than has the great book of humanity itself, when consulted by a
      stupid novelist. The gold all turns into dead leaves. &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; he went
      on with rising animation, &lsquo;a man is not to be called an historian because
      he has expanded unpublished material into great octavo volumes, which are
      shelved unread among the books of information, and should be labelled,
      &ldquo;For external application only. Shake the bottle.&rdquo; It is only French
      frivolity that attaches a serious value to compilations like those. The
      English and Germans despise us. &ldquo;Ineptissimus vir Astier-Réhu,&rdquo; says
      Mommsen somewhere or other in a note.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and it was you, you heartless fellow, who made the poor man read out
      the note before the whole class.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a terrible jaw he gave me. It was nearly as bad as when one day I got
      so tired of hearing him tell us that the will was a lever, a lever with
      which you might lift anything anywhere, that I answered him from my place
      in his own voice: &ldquo;Could you fly with it, sir&mdash;could you fly with
      it?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Freydet, laughing, abandoned his defence of the historian, and began to
      plead for Astier-Réhu as a teacher. But Védrine went off again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A teacher! What is he? A poor creature who has spent his life in
      &ldquo;weeding&rdquo; hundreds of brains, or, in plain terms, destroying whatever in
      them was original and natural, all the living germs which it is the first
      duty of an educator to nourish and protect. To think how the lot of us
      were hoed, and stubbed, and grubbed! One or two did not take kindly to the
      process, but the old fellow went at it with his tools and his nails, till
      he made us all as neat and as flat as a schoolroom bench. And see the
      results of his workmanship! A few rebels, like Herscher, who, from hatred
      of the conventional, go for exaggeration and ugliness, or like myself,
      who, thanks to that old ass, love roughness and contortion so much, that
      my sculpture, they say, is &ldquo;like a bag of walnuts.&rdquo; And the rest of them
      levelled, scraped, and empty!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And pray, what of me?&rsquo; said Freydet, with an affected despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, as for you, Nature has preserved you so far; but look out for
      yourself if you let Crocodilus clip you again. And to think that we have
      public schools to provide us with this sort of pedagogue, and that we
      reward him with endowments, and honours, and a place (save the mark) in
      the National Institute!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretched at his ease in the long grass, with his head on his arm and
      waving a fern, which he used as a sun-screen, Védrine calmly uttered these
      strong remarks, without the slightest play of feature in his broad face,
      pale and puffy like that of an Indian idol. Only the tiny laughing eyes
      broke the general expression of dreamy indolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion was shocked at such treatment of what he was accustomed to
      respect &lsquo;But,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if you are such an enemy of the father, how do
      you manage to be such a friend of the son?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am no more one than the other. I look upon Paul Astier, with his
      imperturbable <i>sang-froid</i> and his pretty-miss complexion, as a
      problem. I should like to live long enough to see what becomes of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Monsieur de Freydet,&rsquo; said Madame Védrine, joining in the
      conversation from the place where she sat, &lsquo;if you only knew what a tool
      he makes of my husband! All the restorations at Mousseaux, the new gallery
      towards the river, the concert-room, the chapel, all were done by Védrine.
      And the Rosen tomb too. He will only be paid for the statue; but the whole
      thing is really his&mdash;conception, arrangement, everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, there, that will do,&rsquo; said the artist quietly. &lsquo;As for Mousseaux,
      the young fellow would certainly have been hard put to it to rediscover a
      fragment of the design under the layers of rubbish that the architects
      have been depositing there for the last thirty years. But the
      neighbourhood was charming, the Duchess amiable and not at all tiresome,
      and there was friend Freydet, whom I had found out at Clos-Jallanges.
      Besides, the truth is I have too many ideas, and am just tormented with
      them. To relieve me of a few is to do me a real service. My brain is like
      a railway junction, where the engines are getting up steam on all the
      lines at once. The young man saw that. He has not many ideas. So he
      purloins mine, and brings them before the public, quite certain that I
      shall not protest But he does not take me in. Don&rsquo;t I know when he is
      going to filch! He preserves his little indifferent air, with no
      expression in his eyes, until suddenly there comes a little nervous twitch
      at the corner of his mouth. Done! Nabbed! I have no doubt he thinks to
      himself, &ldquo;Good Lord, what a simpleton Védrine is!&rdquo; He has not the least
      notion that I watch him and enjoy his little game. Now,&rsquo; said the sculptor
      as he got up, &lsquo;I will show you my Knight, and then we will go over the
      ruin. It is worth looking at, you will find.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing from the terrace into the building, they mounted a semicircle of
      steps and went through a square room, formerly the apartment of the
      Secretary to the Conseil d&rsquo;Etat. It had no floor and no ceiling, all the
      upper storeys had fallen through and showed the blue sky between the huge
      iron girders, now twisted by the fire, which had divided the floors. In a
      corner, against a wall to which were attached long iron pipes overgrown
      with creepers, lay in three pieces a model of the Rosen tomb, buried in
      nettles and rubbish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see,&rsquo; said Védrine, &lsquo;or rather you can&rsquo;t see.&rsquo; And he began to
      describe the monument. The little Princess&rsquo;s conception of a tomb was not
      easy to come up to. Several things had been tried&mdash;reminiscences of
      Egyptian, Assyrian, and Ninevite monuments&mdash;before deciding on
      Védrine&rsquo;s plan, which would raise an outcry among architects, but was
      certainly impressive. A soldier&rsquo;s tomb: an open tent with the canvas
      looped back, disclosing within, before an altar, the wide low sarcophagus,
      modelled on a camp bedstead, on which lay the good Knight Crusader, fallen
      for King and Creed; beside him his broken sword, and at his feet a great
      greyhound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulty of the work and the hardness of the Dalmatian granite,
      which the Princess insisted on having, had obliged Védrine to take mallet
      and chisel himself and to work like an artisan under the tarpaulin at the
      cemetery. Now, at last, after much time and trouble, the canopy was up,
      &lsquo;and that young rascal, Astier, will get some credit from it,&rsquo; added the
      sculptor with a smile in which was no touch of bitterness. Then he lifted
      up an old carpet hanging over a hole in the wall, which had once been a
      door, and led Freydet into the huge ruined hall which served him for a
      studio, roofed with planks and decorated with mats and hangings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It looked with all its litter like a barn, or rather a yard under cover,
      for in a sun-lit corner climbed a fine fig-tree with its twining branches
      and elegant leaves, while close by was the bulk of a broken stove,
      garlanded with ivy and honeysuckle, so as to resemble an old well. Here he
      had been working for two years, summer and winter, in spite, of the fogs
      of the neighbouring river and the bitter cold winds, without a single
      sneeze (his own expression), having the healthful strength of the great
      artists of the Renaissance, as well as their large mould of countenance
      and fertile imagination. Now he was as weary of sculpture and architecture
      as if he had been writing a tragedy. The moment his statue was delivered
      and paid for, wouldn&rsquo;t he be off, nursery and all, for a journey up the
      Nile in a dahabeeah, and paint and paint from morning to night! While he
      spoke he moved away a stool and a bench, and led his friend up to a huge
      block in the rough. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s my warrior. Frankly now, what do you think of
      him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Freydet was somewhat startled and amazed at the colossal dimensions of the
      sleeping hero. The scale was magnified in proportion to the height of the
      canopy, and the roughness of the plaster exaggerated the anatomical
      emphasis characteristic of Védrine. Rather than smooth away the force, he
      gives his work an unfinished earthy surface, as of something still in the
      rock. But as the spectator gazed and began to grasp, the huge form became
      distinct with that impressive and attractive power which is the essence of
      fine art.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Splendid!&rsquo; he exclaimed, with the tone of sincerity. The other winked his
      merry little eyes, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at first sight, eh? My style does not take till you are accustomed to
      it; and I do not feel sure of the Princess, when she comes to look at this
      ugly fellow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Astier was to bring her in a few days, as soon as it had been rubbed
      down and smoothed and was ready to go to the foundry; and the sculptor
      looked forward to the visit with some uncertainty, knowing the taste of
      great ladies, as it is displayed in the stereotyped chatter, which at the
      Salon on five-shilling days runs up and down the picture-rooms, and breaks
      out round the sculpture. Oh, what hypocrisy it is! The only genuine thing
      about them is the spring costume, which they have provided to figure on
      this particular occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And altogether, old fellow,&rsquo; continued Védrine, as he drew his friend out
      of the studio, &lsquo;of all the affectations of Paris, of all the hypocrisies
      of society, the most shameless, the most amusing, is the pretended taste
      for art. It&rsquo;s enough to make you die of laughing; everyone performing a
      mummery, which imposes on nobody. And music, the same! You should just see
      them at the Pop!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They went down a long arcaded passage, full of the same odd vegetation,
      sown there by all the winds of heaven, breaking out in green from the
      hard-beaten ground, and peeping among the paintings on the shrivelled and
      smoke-blackened walls, Presently they came to the principal court,
      formerly gravelled, but now a field, in which were mingled wild grasses,
      plantain, pimpernel, groundsel, and myriads of tiny stems and heads. In
      the middle, fenced off with boards, was a bed of artichokes, strawberries,
      and pumpkins, looking like the garden of some squatter at the edge of a
      virgin forest; and, to complete the illusion, beside it was a little
      building of brick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the bookbinder&rsquo;s garden, and that is his shop,&rsquo; said Védrine,
      pointing to a board over the half-open door, displaying in letters a foot
      long the inscription,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                ALBIN FAGE,

      Bookbinding in all its branches.
</pre>
    <p>
      Fage had been bookbinder to the Cour des Comptes and the Conseil d&rsquo;Etat,
      and having obtained leave to keep his lodge, which had escaped the fire,
      was now, with the exception of the caretaker, the sole tenant of the
      building. &lsquo;Let us go in for a minute,&rsquo; said Védrine; &lsquo;you will find him a
      remarkable specimen.&rsquo; He went nearer and called, &lsquo;Fage! Fage!&rsquo; but the
      humble workshop was empty. In front of the window was the binder&rsquo;s table,
      on which, among a heap of parings, lay his shears. Under a press were some
      green ledgers capped with copper. Strange to remark, everything in the
      room&mdash;the sewing-press, the tressel-table, the empty chair in front
      of it, the shelves piled with books, and even the shaving-mirror hung upon
      the latch&mdash;was on a diminutive scale, adapted to the height and reach
      of a child of twelve years old. It might have been taken for the house of
      a dwarf, or of a bookbinder of Lilliput.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a humpback,&rsquo; whispered Védrine to Frey-det, &lsquo;and a lady&rsquo;s man into
      the bargain, all scent and pomade.&rsquo; A horrible smell like a hairdresser&rsquo;s
      shop, otto of roses and macassar, mingled with the stifling fumes, of
      glue. Védrine called once more in the direction of the back of the shop
      where the bedroom was; then they left, Freydet chuckling at the idea of a
      humpbacked Lovelace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s at a tryst,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are pleased to laugh; but, my dear fellow, the humpback is on the
      best of terms with all the beauties of Paris, if one may believe the
      testimony of his bedroom walls, which are covered with photographs bearing
      the owners&rsquo; names, and headed &ldquo;To Albin,&rdquo; &ldquo;To my dear little Fage.&rdquo; There
      is never any lady to be seen here, but he sometimes comes and tells me
      about his fine octavo, or his pretty little duodecimo, as he calls his
      conquests, according to their height and size.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he is ugly, you say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A perfect monster.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And no money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A poor little bookbinder and worker in cardboard, living on his work and
      his bit of a garden, but very intelligent and learned, with a marvellous
      memory. We shall probably find him wandering about in some corner of the
      building. He is a great dreamer is little Fage, like all sentimentalists.&mdash;This
      way, but look where you step; there are some awkward places.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were going up a huge staircase, of which the lower steps still
      remained, as did the balustrade, rusty, split, and in places twisted. Then
      suddenly they turned off by a fragile wooden bridge, resting on the
      supports of the staircase, between high walls on which were dimly visible
      the remains of huge frescoes, cracked, decayed, and blackened with soot,
      the hind legs of a horse, a woman&rsquo;s torso undraped, with inscriptions
      almost illegible on panels that had lost their gilding, &lsquo;Meditation,&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Silence,&rsquo; &lsquo;Trade uniting the nations of the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first floor a long gallery with a vaulted roof, as in the
      amphitheatre at Aries or Nîmes, stretched away between smoke-stained
      walls, covered with huge fissures, remains of plaster and iron work, and
      tangled vegetation. At the entrance to this passage was inscribed on the
      wall, &lsquo;Corridor des Huissiers.&rsquo; On the next floor they found much the same
      thing, only that here, the roof having given way, the gallery was nothing
      but a long terrace of brambles climbing up to the undestroyed arcades and
      falling down in disordered waving festoons to the level of the courtyard.
      From this second floor could be seen the roofs of the neighbouring houses,
      the whitewashed walls of the barracks in the Rue de Poitiers, and the tall
      plane trees of the Padovani mansion, with the rooks&rsquo; nests, abandoned till
      the winter, swinging in their top branches. Below was the deserted court
      in full sunlight, with the little garden and tiny house of the bookbinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just look, old boy, there&rsquo;s a good lot of it here,&rsquo; said Védrine to his
      friend, pointing to the wild exuberant vegetation of every species which
      ran riot over the whole building. &lsquo;If Crocodilus saw all these weeds, what
      a rage he would be in!&rsquo; Suddenly he started, and said, &lsquo;Well, I never!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, near the bookbinder&rsquo;s house below, came into sight
      Astier-Réhu, recognisable by his long frock-coat of a metallic green and
      his large wide &lsquo;topper.&rsquo; Most people in the neighbourhood knew this hat,
      which, set on the back of a grey curly head, distinguished, like a halo,
      the hierarch of erudition. It was Crocodilus himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was talking earnestly to a man of very small stature, whose bare head
      shone with hair-oil, and whose tight-fitting, light-coloured coat showed
      in all its elegance the deformity of his back. Their words were not
      audible, but Astier seemed much excited. He brandished his stick and bent
      himself forward over the face of the little creature, who for his part was
      perfectly calm, and stood, as if his mind was made up, with his two large
      hands behind him folded under his hump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The cripple does work for the Institute, does he?&rsquo; said Freydet, who
      remembered now that his master had uttered the name of Fage. Védrine did
      not answer. He was watching the action of the two men, whose conversation
      at this moment suddenly stopped, the humpback going into his house with a
      gesture which seemed to say, &lsquo;As you please,&rsquo; while Astier with angry
      strides made for the gate of the building towards the Rue de Lille, then
      paused, turned back to the shop, went in, and closed the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s odd,&rsquo; muttered the sculptor. &lsquo;Why did Fage never tell me? What a
      mysterious little fellow it is! But I dare say they have the same taste
      for the &ldquo;octavo&rdquo; and the &ldquo;duodecimo&rdquo;!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For shame, Védrine!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The visit done, Freydet went slowly up the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay, thinking about
      his book and his aspirations towards the Académie, which had received a
      severe shock from the home truths he had been hearing. How like the man is
      to the boy! How soon the character is in its essence complete! After an
      interval of twenty-five years, beneath the wrinkles and grey hairs and
      other changes, with which life disguises the outer man, the schoolfellows
      found each other just what they were when they sat together in class: one
      wilful, high-spirited, rebellious; the other obedient and submissive, with
      a tendency to indolence, which had been fostered by his quiet country
      life. After all Védrine was perhaps right. Even if he was sure of
      succeeding, was the thing worth the trouble? He was particularly anxious
      about his invalid sister, who, while he went about canvassing, must be
      left all alone at Clos-Jallanges. A few days&rsquo; absence had already made her
      feel nervous and low, and the morning&rsquo;s post had brought a miserable
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was by this time passing before the dragoon barracks; and his attention
      was caught by the appearance of the paupers, waiting on the other side of
      the street for the distribution of the remains of the soup. They had come
      long before for fear of missing their turn, and were seated on the benches
      or standing in a line against the parapet of the quay. Foul and grimy,
      with the hair and beard of human dogs, and dressed in the filthiest rags,
      they waited like a herd, neither moving nor speaking to each other, but
      peering into the great barrack-yard to catch the arrival of the porringers
      and the adjutant&rsquo;s signal to come up. It was horrible to see in the
      brilliant sunlight the silent row of savage eyes and hungry faces, fixed
      with the same animal look upon the wide-open gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you doing there, my dear boy?&rsquo; said a voice, and Astier-Réhu, in
      high spirits, took his pupil&rsquo;s arm. The poet pointed to the pathetic group
      on the opposite pavement. &lsquo;Ah, yes,&rsquo; said the historian, &lsquo;Ah, yes.&rsquo; He had
      in truth no eyes for anything outside books, nor any direct and personal
      perception of the facts of life. Indeed, from the way in which he took
      Freydet off, saying as he did so, &lsquo;You may as well go with me as far as
      the Institute,&rsquo; it was clear that he did not approve the habit of mooning
      in the streets when you ought to be better employed. Leaning gently on his
      favourite&rsquo;s arm, he began to tell him of his rapturous delight at having
      chanced upon a most astonishing discovery, a letter about the Académie
      from the Empress Catherine to Diderot, just in time for his forthcoming
      address to the Grand-Duke. He meant to read the letter at the meeting and
      perhaps to present his Highness, in the name of the Society, with the
      original in the handwriting of his ancestress. Baron Huchenard would burst
      with envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And, by the way, about my Charles the Fifths, you know! It&rsquo;s absolutely
      false. Here is something to confute the old backbiter,&rsquo; and he clapped
      with his thick short hand a heavy leather pocket-book. He was so happy
      that he tried to arouse an answering happiness in Freydet by leading the
      conversation to the topic of yesterday&mdash;his candidature for the first
      place in the Académie that should be vacant. It would be delightful when
      the master and the scholar sat together under the dome! &lsquo;And you will find
      how pleasant it is, and how comfortable. It cannot be imagined till you
      are there.&rsquo; The moment of entrance, he seemed to say, put an end to the
      miseries of life. At that threshold they might beat in vain. You soared
      into a region of peace and light, above envy, above criticism, blessed for
      ever! All was won, and nothing left to desire. Ah, the Académie! Those who
      spoke ill of it spoke in ignorance, or in jealousy, because they could not
      get in. The apes, the dunces!
    </p>
    <p>
      His strong voice rose till it made everyone turn as he went along the
      quay. Some recognised him and mentioned his name. The booksellers and the
      vendors of engravings and curiosities, standing at their stalls, and
      accustomed to see him go by at his regular hours, stepped back and bowed
      respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Freydet, look at that,&rsquo; said his master, pointing to the Palais Mazarin,
      to which they had now come. &lsquo;There it is! There&rsquo;s the Institute as I saw
      it on the Didot books when I was a lad. I said to myself then, &ldquo;I will get
      into that;&rdquo; and I have got in. Now, my boy, it is your turn to use your
      will. Good luck to you.&rsquo; He stepped briskly in at the gate to the left of
      the main building, and went on into a series of large paved courts, silent
      and majestic, his figure throwing a lengthening shadow upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      He disappeared; but Freydet was gazing still, struck motionless. And on
      his kindly round brown face and in his soft, full-orbed eyes was the same
      expression as had been on the visages of the human dogs who waited before
      the barracks for their soup. Henceforward, whenever he looked at the
      Institute, that expression would always come over his face.

       alt="A Select Reception, at the Padovani Mansion 102 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      It was the evening of a great dinner, to be followed by a select
      reception, at the Padovani mansion. The Grand-Duke Leopold was
      entertaining at the table of his &lsquo;respected friend,&rsquo; as he called the
      Duchess, some members selected from the various departments of the
      Institute, and so making his return to the five Académies for their
      courteous reception of him and for the complimentary harangue of the
      President. Diplomatic society was, as usual, well represented at the house
      of a lady whose husband had been Ambassador; but the Institute had the
      chief place, and the arrangement of the guests showed the object of the
      dinner. The Grand-Duke, seated opposite the hostess, had Madame Astier on
      his right, and on his left the Countess Foder, wife of the First Secretary
      of the Finnish Embassy, acting as Ambassador. On the right of the Duchess
      sat Léonard Astier, and on her left Monsignor Adriani, the Papal Nuncio.
      Then came successively Baron Huchenard, representing the Inscriptions et
      Belles-Lettres; Mourad Bey, the Ambassador of the Porte; Delpech the
      chemist, Member of the Académie des Sciences; the Belgian Minister; Landry
      the musician, of the Beaux-Arts; Danjou the dramatist, one of Picherals
      &lsquo;Players&rsquo;; and, lastly, the Prince d&rsquo;Athis, whose twofold claims to
      distinction as diplomatist and Member of the Académie des Sciences Morales
      et Politiques combined the characteristics of the two sets in the circle.
      At the ends of the table were the General acting as Aide-de-camp to His
      Highness, the young Count Adriani, nephew of the Nuncio, and Lavaux, whose
      presence was indispensable at every social gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feminine element was lacking in charm. The Countess Foder, red-haired,
      small, and lively, enveloped in lace to the tip of her little pointed
      nose, looked like a squirrel with a cold in its head. Baroness Huchenard,
      a lady of no particular age and with a moustache, produced the effect of a
      very fat old gentleman in a low dress. Madame Astier, in a velvet dress
      partly open at the neck, a present from the Duchess, had sacrificed on the
      altar of friendship the pleasure she would have had in displaying her arms
      and shoulders, the remains of her beauty; and thanks to this delicate
      attention the Duchess Padovani looked as if she were the only woman at
      dinner. The Duchess is elegantly dressed, tall and fair, with a tiny head
      and fine eyes of a golden hazel colour&mdash;eyes whose shifting haughty
      glance, from under long dark brows almost meeting, shows their power of
      expressing kindness, affection, or anger. Her nose is short, her mouth
      emotional and sensitive, and her complexion has the brilliancy of a young
      woman&rsquo;s, owing to her custom of sleeping in the afternoon when she is
      going out in the evening or receiving friends at her own house. A long
      residence abroad at Vienna, St. Petersburg, and Constantinople, where as
      the wife of the French Ambassador it had been her duty to set the fashion
      to French society, has left in her manners a certain air of superior
      information, which the ladies of Paris find it hard to forgive. She talks
      graciously to them as though they were foreigners, and explains things to
      them which they understand as well as she. In her house in the Rue de
      Poitiers the Duchess still acts as though representing Paris among the
      Kurds. It is the sole defect of this noble and splendid lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though there were, so to speak, no women, no bright dresses showing arms
      and shoulders and breaking the monotony of black coats with a blaze of
      jewels and flowers, still the table was not without colour. There was the
      violet cassock of the Nuncio with his broad silk sash, the purple <i>Chechia</i>
      of Mourad Bey, and the red tunic of the Papal Guard with its gold collar,
      blue embroideries, and gold braid on the breast, decorated also with the
      huge brilliant cross of the Legion of Honour, which the young Italian had
      received that very morning, the President thinking it proper to reward the
      successful delivery of the Cardinal&rsquo;s hat. Scattered about, too, were
      ribbons green, blue, and red, and the silvery gleam and sparkling stars of
      decorations and orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten o&rsquo;clock. The dinner is almost over, but not one of the flowers
      elaborately arranged round plates and dishes has been disturbed, there
      have been no raised voices or animated gestures. Yet the fare is excellent
      at the Padovani mansion, one of the few houses in Paris where they still
      have wine. The dinner betrays the presence in the house of an epicure, and
      the epicure is not the Duchess, who, like all leaders of French fashion,
      thinks the dinner good if she has on a becoming dress and the table is
      carefully and tastefully decorated. No; the epicure is the lady&rsquo;s humble
      servant, the Prince d&rsquo;Athis, a man of cultivated palate and fastidious
      appetite, spoilt by club cooking and not to be satisfied by silver plate
      or the sight of fine liveries and irreproachable white calves. It is for
      his sake that the fair Antonia admits among her occupations the care of
      the <i>menu</i>, it is for him that she provides highly seasoned dishes
      and fiery wines of Burgundy, which it must be admitted have not on this
      particular occasion dispelled the coldness of the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dessert there is the same deadness, stiffness, and restraint that
      marked the first course; hardly has a tinge of colour touched the ladies&rsquo; 
      cheeks or noses. It is a dinner of wax dolls, official,-magnificent, with
      the magnificence which comes chiefly of ample room, lofty ceilings, and
      seats placed so far apart as to preclude all friendly touching of chairs.
      A gloomy chilly underground feeling separates the guests, in spite of the
      soft breath of the June night floating in from the gardens through the
      half-open shutters and gently swelling the silk blinds. The conversation
      is distant and constrained, the lips scarcely move and have an unmeaning
      smile. Not a remark is real, not one makes its way to the mind of the
      hearer; they are as perfectly artificial as the sweetmeats among which
      they are dropped. The speeches, like the faces, are masked, and it is
      lucky they are, for if at this moment the mask were to be taken off, and
      the true thoughts disclosed, how dismayed the noble company would be!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grand-Duke, who has a broad pale face framed by extra-black trim round
      whiskers, just such a royal personage as you see in an illustrated paper,
      is questioning Baron Huchenard with much interest about his recent book,
      and thinking to himself: &lsquo;Oh dear, how this learned gentleman does bore me
      with his primitive dwellings! How much better off I should be at <i>Roxelane</i>,
      where sweet little Déa is dancing in the ballet! The author of <i>Roxelane</i>
      is here, I understand, but he is a middle-aged man, very ugly and very
      dull. And to think of the ankles of little Déa!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nuncio, who has an intellectual face of the Roman type, large nose,
      thin lips, black eyes and sallow complexion, has leant on one side to
      listen to the history of the habitations of Man. He is looking at his
      nails, which shine like shells, and is thinking: &lsquo;At the Embassy this
      morning I ate a delicious <i>misto fritto</i> and I haven&rsquo;t got rid of it.
      Gioachimo has pulled my sash too tight; I wish I could get away from the
      table.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Turkish Ambassador, thick-lipped, yellow, and coarse, with his fez
      over his eyes and a poke in his neck, is filling the glass of Baroness
      Huchenard and saying, &lsquo;How disgusting in these Westerns to bring their
      women into society, when they are as dilapidated as this! I had rather be
      impaled right off than exhibit that fat creature as my wife.&rsquo; The Baroness
      is thanking His Excellency with a mincing smile, which covers the thought
      &lsquo;This Turk is a revolting beast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor are Madame Astier&rsquo;s spoken thoughts any more in harmony with her
      internal reflections: &lsquo;I only hope Paul will not have forgotten to go for
      grandpapa. It will be an effective scene when the old man comes in,
      supported on the arm of his great-grandson. Perhaps we may get an order
      out of His Highness.&rsquo; Then, as she looks affectionately at the Duchess,
      she thinks: &lsquo;She is looking very handsome this evening. Some good news no
      doubt about the promised Embassy. Make the best of your time, my dear; in
      a month Sammy will be married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Astier is not mistaken. The Grand-Duke on arriving announced to his
      &lsquo;respected friend&rsquo; the President&rsquo;s promise to appoint D&rsquo;Athis within the
      next few days. The Duchess is filled with à repressed delight, which
      shines through as it were, and gives her a marvellous brilliance. To this
      height she has raised the man of her choice! And already she is making
      plans for removing her own establishment to St. Petersburg, to a mansion
      not too far from the Embassy; while the Prince, with his pale sunk cheeks
      and rapt look&mdash;the look whose penetration Bismarck could never
      sustain&mdash;checks upon his contemptuous lips the smile at once
      mysterious and dogmatic, compounded of diplomacy and learning, and thinks
      to himself: &lsquo;Now Colette must make up her mind. She could come out there,
      we could be married quietly at the Chapelle des Pages, and all would be
      done and past recall before the Duchess heard of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus many a reflection ludicrously inappropriate to the occasion
      passes from guest to guest under the same safe wrapper. Here you have the
      pleased beatitude of Léonard Astier, who has this very morning received
      the order of Stanislas (second class), as a return for presenting to His
      Highness a copy of his speech with the autograph letter of Catherine
      pinned to the first page and very ingeniously worked into the
      complimentary address. This letter was the great thing at the meeting, had
      been mentioned in the papers two days running, and heard of all over
      Europe, giving to the name of Astier, to his collection, and to his work,
      that astounding and disproportionate echo with which the Press now
      multiplies any passing event. Now Baron Huchenard might do his best to
      bite, might mumble as he pleased in his insinuating tones, &lsquo;I ask you, my
      dear colleague, to observe.&rsquo; But no one would listen. And the &lsquo;first
      collector in France&rsquo; was perfectly aware of it. See what a savage look he
      casts at his dear colleague in the pauses of his scientific harangue! What
      venom is in every deeply graven hollow of his porous, pumice-stone face!
    </p>
    <p>
      Handsome Danjou is also furious, but for other reasons than the Baron. The
      Duchess has not asked his wife. The exclusion is painful to his feelings
      as a husband, a part of a man no less sensitive than the original <i>ego</i>;
      and in spite of his wish to shine before the Grand-Duke, the witticisms as
      good as new, which he was prepared with, will not go off. Another who does
      not feel comfortable is Delpech the chemist, whom His Highness, when he
      was presented, congratulated on his interpretation of the cuneiform
      character, confounding him with his colleague of the Académie des
      Inscriptions. It should be said that, with the exception of Danjou, whose
      comedies are popular abroad, the Grand-Duke has never heard of any of the
      Academic celebrities introduced to him at this dinner. Lavaux this very
      morning, in concert with the Aide-de-camp, arranged a set of cards bearing
      each the name of a guest with the titles of his principal works. The fact
      that His Highness did not get more confused among the list than he did
      proves much presence of mind and an Imperial memory. But the evening is
      not over, and other stars of learning are about to appear. Already may be
      heard the muffled rolling of wheels and the slamming of carriages putting
      down at the door. The Prince will have more chances yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in a weak, slow voice, seeking for words and losing half of
      them in his nose, His Highness is discussing with Astier-Réhu a point of
      history suggested by the letter of Catherine II. The ewers have long
      completed the round, no one is eating or drinking any more, no one is even
      breathing, for fear of interrupting the conversation; all the company are
      in a hypnotic trance, and&mdash;a remarkable effect of lévitation&mdash;are
      literally hanging upon the Imperial lips. Suddenly the august nose is
      silent, and Léonard Astier, who has made a show of resistance in order to
      improve the effect of his opponent&rsquo;s victory, throws up his arms like
      broken foils and says with an air of surrender, &lsquo;Ah, Your Highness has
      mated me!&rsquo; The charm is broken, the company feel the ground under them
      again, everyone rises in a slight flutter of applause, the doors are
      thrown open, the Duchess takes the arm of the Grand-Duke, Mourad Bey that
      of the Baroness, and while, with a sound of sweeping-dresses and chairs
      pushed Lack, the assembly files out, Firmin, the <i>maître d&rsquo;hôtel</i>,
      solemn and dignified, is privately doing a sum. &lsquo;In any other house this
      dinner would have been worth to me forty pounds: with her, I&rsquo;ll warrant,
      it won&rsquo;t be a dozen;&rsquo; to which he adds aloud, as if he would spit his
      anger upon Her Grace&rsquo;s train, &lsquo;Grr! you hag!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With Your Highness&rsquo;s permission&mdash;my grandfather, M. Jean Réhu, the
      oldest member in the whole Institute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The high notes of Madame Astier&rsquo;s voice ring in the great drawing-room,
      not nearly filled, though the guests invited to the reception have already
      arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      She speaks very loud to make grandpapa understand to whom he is being
      introduced and answer accordingly. Old Réhu looks grand, drawing up his
      tall figure and still carrying high his little Creole face darkened and
      cracked with age. Paul, graceful and pleasing, supports him on one side,
      his granddaughter on the other; Astier-Réhu is behind. The family makes a
      sentimental group in the style of Greuze. It would look well on one of the
      pale-coloured tapestries with which the room is decorated, tapestries&mdash;a
      strange thing to think of&mdash;scarcely older than Réhu himself. The
      Grand-Duke, much affected, tries to say something happy, but the author of
      the Letters to Urania is not upon his cards. He gets out of it by a few
      vague complimentary phrases, in answer to which old Réhu, supposing that
      he is being asked as usual about his age, says, &lsquo;Ninety-eight years in a
      fortnight, Sir.&rsquo; His next attempt does not fit much better with His
      Highness&rsquo;s gracious congratulations. &lsquo;Not since 1803, Sir; the town must
      be much changed.&rsquo; During the progress of this singular dialogue, Paul is
      whispering to his mother, &lsquo;You may see him home if you like; I won&rsquo;t have
      anything more to do with him; he&rsquo;s in an awful temper. In the carriage he
      was kicking me all the time in the legs, to work off his fidgets, he
      said.&rsquo; The young man himself had an unpleasant ring in his voice this
      evening, and in his charming face something set and hard, which his mother
      knew well, and noticed immediately on coming into the room. What is the
      matter? She watched him, trying to read the meaning in his light eyes,
      which, however, harder and keener than usual, revealed nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the chill, the ceremonious chill, prevailed here no less than at the
      dinner-table. The guests kept apart in groups, the few ladies in a circle
      upon low chairs, the gentlemen standing or walking about with a pretence
      of serious conversation, but obviously engaged in attracting His
      Highness&rsquo;s attention. It was for His Highness that Landry the musician
      stood pensive by the chimney-piece, gazing upward with his inspired brow
      and his apostolic beard; for him that on the other side Delpech the
      chemist stood meditative with his chin upon his hand, poring intently with
      gathered brows as if watching the precipitation of a compound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laniboire the philosopher, famous for his likeness to Pascal, was
      wandering round, perpetually passing before the sofa, where, unable to
      escape from Jean Réhu, sat the Prince. The hostess had forgotten to
      present him, and his fine nose looked longer than usual and seemed to be
      making a desperate appeal: &lsquo;Cannot you see that this is the nose of
      Pascal?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same sofa Madame Eviza was shooting between her scarcely parted
      eyelids a look which asked His Highness to name his own price if he would
      but be seen at her reception next Monday. Ah! change the scene as you
      will, it is always the same performance&mdash;pretension, meanness,
      readiness to bow down, the courtier&rsquo;s appetite for self-humiliation and
      self-abasement. We need not decline the visits of majesty; we are provided
      with all the properties required for the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;General.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Highness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall never be in time for the ballet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why are we staying, Sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know; there&rsquo;s to be a surprise when the Nuncio is gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While these few words passed in an undertone between the pair, they
      neither looked at each other nor changed a muscle of their ceremonial
      countenances. The Aide-de-camp had copied from his master the nasal
      intonation, the absence of gesture, the fixed attitude on the edge of the
      seat with the bowed arm against the side. He was rigid as on parade or in
      the Imperial box at the Théâtre Michel. Old Réhu stood before them, he
      would not sit down; he was still talking, still exhibiting the dusty
      stores of his memory, the people he had known, the many fashions in which
      he had dressed. The more distant the time, the clearer his recollection.
      &lsquo;That is a thing I have seen,&rsquo; says he, as he pauses at the end of a
      story, with his eyes fixed, as it were, upon the flying past, and then off
      upon a fresh subject. He had been with Talma at Brunoy, he had been in the
      drawing-room of Josephine, full of musical boxes and artificial
      humming-birds covered with jewels, which sang and clapped their wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of doors on the terrace, in the warm darkness of the garden, was heard
      low conversation and stifled laughter, coming from the place where the
      cigars were visible as a ring of red dots. Lavaux was amusing himself by
      getting the young Guardsman to tell Danjou and Paul Astier the story of
      the Cardinal&rsquo;s hat. &lsquo;And the lady, Count&mdash;the lady at the station.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Cristo, qu&rsquo;elle était bella!&rsquo; said the Italian in a low voice, and added
      correctively, &lsquo;sim-patica, surtout, simpatica.&rsquo; Charming and responsive&mdash;this
      was his general idea of the ladies of Paris. He only wished he need not go
      back. The French wine had loosed his tongue, and he began describing his
      life in the Guards, the advantages of the profession, the hope which they
      all had on entering it that they might find a rich wife&mdash;that at one
      of His Holiness&rsquo;s audiences they would dazzle some wealthy English
      Catholic or a fanatical Spaniard from South America come to bring her
      offering to the Vatican. &lsquo;L&rsquo;ouniforme est zouli, comprenez; et pouis les
      en-fortounes del Saint Père, cela nous donne à nous autres ses soldats oun
      prestigio roumanesque, cava-leresque, qualque sose qui plaît aux dames
      zénérale-menté.&rsquo; It must be allowed that with his youthful manly face, his
      gold braid shining softly in the moonlight, and his white leather
      breeches, he did recall the heroes of Artosto or Tasso.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my dear Pepino,&rsquo; said fat Lavaux, in his mocking and disagreeable
      tone, &lsquo;if you want a good match, here it is at your elbow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How so? Where?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Astier started and became attentive. The mention of a good match
      always made him fear that some one was stealing his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Duchess, of course. Old Padovani can&rsquo;t stand another stroke.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the Prince d&rsquo;Athis?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll never marry her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavaux was a good authority, being the friend of the Prince, and of the
      Duchess, too, for that matter; though, seeing that the establishment must
      shortly split, he stood on the side which he thought the safest &lsquo;Go in
      boldly, my dear Count; there&rsquo;s money, lots of it, and a fine connection,
      and a lady still well enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cristo, qu&rsquo;elle est bella!&rsquo; said the Italian, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;E simpatica,&rsquo; said Danjou, with a sneer. At which the Guardsman after a
      moment&rsquo;s amazement, delighted to find an Academician with so much
      perception, exclaimed: &lsquo;Si, simpatica, précisamenté!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then,&rsquo; continued Lavaux, &lsquo;if you are fond of dyes, and enamel, and
      padding, you&rsquo;ll get it. I believe she&rsquo;s a marvel of construction, the best
      customer that Charrière has.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke out loud and quite freely, right in front of the dining-room. The
      garden door was slightly open, and through the crack the light fell upon
      the broad red impudent face of the parasite, and the warm air floated
      laden with the rich smell of the dinner which he had eaten and was
      repaying in mean dirty slanders. There&rsquo;s for your <i>truffes farcies</i>;
      there&rsquo;s for your <i>gelinottes</i>, and your &lsquo;<i>chateaux</i>&rsquo; at fifteen
      shillings a glass! Danjou and he have got together on purpose to play this
      popular game of running-down; and a great deal they know and a great deal
      they tell. Lavaux serves the ball and Danjou returns. And the simple
      Guardsman, not knowing how much to believe, tries to laugh, with a horrid
      fear lest the Duchess should catch them, and is much relieved when he
      hears his uncle calling him from the other end of the terrace. The Papal
      Embassy shuts up early, and since his little misfortune he has been kept
      strictly to hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good night, gentlemen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good luck to you, young man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nuncio is gone; now for the surprise. At a signal from the Duchess,
      the author of <i>Roxelane</i> took his place at the piano and swept his
      beard over the keys as he struck two penetrating chords. Immediately at
      the far end of the rooms the curtains were drawn from the door, and down
      the vista of brilliant apartments, tripping along on the tips of her
      little gilt slippers, came a charming brunette in the close bodice and
      puffed skirts of the ballet, conducted at arm&rsquo;s-length by a gloomy person
      with hair in rolls and a cadaverous countenance divided by a dead black
      moustache. It is Déa! Déa, the folly of the hour, the fashionable toy,
      accompanied by her instructor, Valère, the ballet-master at the opera. <i>Roxelane</i>
      was taken first this evening; and the girl, warm from her triumphant
      performance, had come to give her dance again for the benefit of the
      Duchess&rsquo;s Imperial guest. A more delightful surprise his respected friend
      could not have devised. What more exquisite than to have all to yourself,
      close to yourself, and within an inch of your face, the pretty whirl of
      muslin and the panting of the fresh young breath, and to hear the sinews
      of the little creature strain like the sheets of a sail! His Highness was
      not alone in this opinion. The moment the dance began the men drew
      together, selfishly making a close ring of black coats and leaving the few
      ladies present to see what they could from outside. Even the Grand-Duke is
      hustled and shoved in the press: for as the dance quickens the circle
      narrows, till there is scarcely room for the movement. Men of letters and
      of politics, breathing hard, thrust their heads forward, while their
      decorations swing like cow-bells, and grinning from ear to ear show their
      watery lips and toothless jaws with grotesque animal cachinnations. Even
      the Prince d&rsquo;Athis stoops with less contempt for humanity, as he gazes
      upon this marvel of youth and fairy grace, who with the tips of her toes
      takes off the masks of convention; and the Turk, Mourad Bey, who has sat
      the whole evening without a word in the depths of an armchair, is now
      gesticulating in the front row with open nostrils and staring eyes.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      In the midst of the wild shouts of applause the girl springs and leaps
      with so harmonious a concealment of the muscular working of her frame,
      that her dance might seem as easy as the hovering of a dragon-fly, but for
      the few drops on her firm rounded neck and the smile, forced, tense, and
      almost painful, at the corner of her mouth, which betray the exhausting
      effort of the exquisite little creature, Paul Astier, who did not care for
      dancing, had stayed on the terrace to smoke. The applause and the thin
      sounds of the piano, audible in the distance, made an accompaniment to his
      reflections, which took shape little by little, even as his outward eyes,
      growing accustomed to the dark, made out by degrees in the garden the
      trunks of the trees and their quivering leaves, and far away at the end
      the delicate tracery of an old-fashioned trellis against the wall. It was
      so hard to succeed; one must hold on so long to reach the desired point,
      always close at hand and always receding. Why was it that Colette seemed
      every moment on the point of falling into his arms, and yet when he went
      back he had to begin again from the beginning? It looked as if in his
      absence some one for amusement pulled down his work. Who was it? It was
      that dead fellow, confound him! He ought to be at her side from morning to
      night; but how could he, with the perpetual necessity of running after
      money?
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a light step, a soft sound of velvet. It was his mother looking
      for him. Why did he not come into the drawing-room with all the rest? She
      leaned over the balustrade beside him and wanted to know what he was
      thinking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, nothing, nothing.&rsquo; But further pressed he came out with it. Well, the
      fact was&mdash;the fact was&mdash;that he had had enough of starving. Dun,
      dun, dun. One hole stopped and another opened. He would not stand any more
      of it, so there!
    </p>
    <p>
      From the drawing-room came loud exclamations and wild laughter, together
      with the expressionless voice of Valère, directing the dancer in the
      imitation of an old-fashioned ballet figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How much do you want?&rsquo; whispered the mother trembling. She had never seen
      him like this before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s no use; it&rsquo;s more than you could possibly manage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How much?&rsquo; she asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eight hundred.&rsquo; And the agent must have it tomorrow by five o&rsquo;clock, or
      else he would take possession. There would be a sale and all sorts of
      horrors. Sooner than that&mdash;and here he ground his cigar between his
      teeth as he said the last words&mdash;&lsquo;better make a hole in my
      frontispiece.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother had heard enough. &lsquo;Hush! hush!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;By five o&rsquo;clock
      to-morrow? Hush!&rsquo; And she flung herself upon him, and she pressed her
      hands in agony upon his lips, as if she would arrest there the appalling
      sentence of death.

      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That night she could not sleep. Eight hundred pounds! eight hundred
      pounds! The words went to and fro in her head. Where were they to be
      found? To whom could she apply? There was so little time. Names and faces
      flashed before her, passing for a moment where the pale gleam of the
      night-light fell on the ceiling, only to disappear and be replaced by
      other names and other faces, which vanished as quickly in their turn.
      Freydet? She had just made use of him. Sammy? Had nothing till he married.
      Besides, did anybody do such a thing as to borrow or lend eight hundred
      pounds? No one but a poet from the country. In Parisian society money
      never appears on the scene; it is assumed that you have it and are above
      these details, like the people in genteel comedy. A breach of this
      convention would banish the transgressor from respectable company.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while Madame Astier pursued her feverish thoughts she saw beside her
      the round back of her husband rising and falling peacefully. It was one of
      the depressing incidents of their joint life that they had lain thus side
      by side for thirty years, having nothing in common but the bed. But never
      had the isolation of her surly bedfellow so strongly aroused her
      indignation. What was the use of waking him, of talking to him about the
      boy and his desperate threat? She knew perfectly well that he would not
      believe her, nor so much as move the big back which protected his repose.
      She was inclined for a minute to fall upon him, to pummel him, and scratch
      him, and rouse him out of his selfish slumbers by shouting in his ear:
      &lsquo;Léonard, your papers are on fire!&rsquo; And as the thought of the papers
      flashed madly across her mind she almost leaped out of bed. She had got
      her eight hundred! The drawers upstairs! How was it she had not thought of
      them before? There she lay, till day dawned and the night-light went out
      with a sputter, content and motionless, arranging what she should do, with
      the look of a thief in her open eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the usual hour she was dressed, and all the morning prowled about
      the rooms, watching her husband. He talked of going out, but changed his
      mind, and went on with his sorting till breakfast. Between his study and
      the attic he went to and fro with armfuls of pamphlets, humming a careless
      tune. He had not feeling enough to perceive the constrained agitation
      which surcharged the air with nervous electricity and played among the
      furniture in the cupboards, and upon the handles of the doors. He worked
      on undisturbed. At table he was talkative, told idiotic stories, which she
      knew by heart, interminable as the process of crumbling with his knife his
      favourite cheese. Piece after piece of cheese he took, and still one
      anecdote followed another. And when the time came for going to the
      Institute, where the Dictionary Committee was to sit before the regular
      meeting, how long he took to start! and in spite of her eagerness to get
      him off quick, what an age he spent over every little thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he turned the corner of the street, without waiting to shut the
      window, she darted to the serving-hatch, crying, &lsquo;Corentine, call a cab,
      quick!&rsquo; He was gone at last, and she flew up the little staircase to the
      attic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crouching down to keep clear of the low ceiling she began to try a bunch
      of keys in the lock which fastened the bar of the drawers. She could not
      fit it. She could not wait. She would have forced away, without scruple, a
      side of the frame, but her fingers gave way and her nails broke. She
      wanted something to prise with. She opened the drawer of the card-table:
      and there lay three yellow scrawls. They were the very things she was
      looking for&mdash;the letters of Charles V.! Such miracles do happen
      sometimes!
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent down to the low-arched window to make sure, and read: &lsquo;François
      Rabelais, maître en toutes sciences et bonnes lettres.&rsquo; Enough! She
      started up, hitting her head hard as she did so, and was not aware of it
      till she was in the cab and on her way to the shop of the famous Bos in
      the Rue de l&rsquo;Abbaye.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got down at the corner of the street. It is a short quiet street,
      overshadowed by St. Germain des Près and by the old red brick buildings of
      the School of Surgery. A few of the surgeons&rsquo; carriages, professional
      broughams with splendid liveries, were in waiting. Scarcely anyone was
      about. Pigeons were feeding on the pavement, and flew away as she came to
      the shop opposite the school. It offers both books and curiosities, and
      exhibits an archaic inscription, highly appropriate to such a nook of Old
      Paris: &lsquo;Bos: Antiquary and Palaeographer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The shop-front displayed something of all sorts: old manuscripts, ancient
      ledgers with mould spots on the edges, missals with damaged gilding,
      book-clasps and book-covers. To the upper panes were fastened assignats,
      old placards, plans of Paris, ballads, military franks with spots of
      blood, autographs of all ages, some verses by Madame Lafargue, two letters
      from Chateaubriand to &lsquo;Pertuzé, Boot-maker, names of celebrities ancient
      and modern at the foot of an invitation to dinner, or perhaps a request
      for money, a complaint of poverty, a love letter, &amp;c, enough to cure
      anyone of writing for ever. All the autographs were priced; and as Madame
      Astier paused for a moment before the window she might see next to a
      letter of Rachel, price 12L., a letter from Léonard Astier-Réhu to Petit
      Séquard, his publisher, price 2s. But this was not what she came for: she
      was trying to discover, behind the screen of green silk, the face of her
      intended customer, the master of the establishment. She was seized with a
      sudden fear: suppose he was not at home after all!
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of Paul waiting gave her determination, and she went into the
      dark, close, dusty room. She was taken at once into a little closet
      behind, and began to explain her business to M. Bos, who, with his large
      red face and disordered hair, looked like a speaker at a public meeting. A
      temporary difficulty&mdash;her husband did not like to come himself&mdash;and
      so&mdash;&mdash; But before she could finish her lie, M. Bos, with a
      &lsquo;Pray, madame, pray,&rsquo; had produced a cheque on the Crédit Lyonnais, and
      was accompanying her with the utmost politeness to her cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A very genteel person,&rsquo; he said to himself, much pleased with his
      acquisition, while she, as she took the cheque out of the glove into which
      it had been slipped, and looked again at the satisfactory figure, was
      thinking What a delightful man!&rsquo; She had no remorse, not even the slight
      recoil which comes from the mere fact that the thing is done. A woman has
      not these feelings. She wears natural blinkers, which prevent her from,
      seeing anything but the thing which she desires at the moment, and keep
      her from the reflections which at the critical moment embarrass a man. She
      thought at intervals, of course, of her husband&rsquo;s anger when he discovered
      the theft, but she saw it, as it were, dim in the distance. Nay, it was
      rather a satisfaction to add this to all she had gone through since
      yesterday, and say to herself, &lsquo;I can bear it for my child!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For beneath her outward calm, her external envelope as a woman of Academic
      fashion, lay a certain thing that exists in all women, fashionable or not,
      and that thing is passion. It is the pedal which works the feminine
      instrument, not always discovered by the husband or the lover, but always
      by the son. In the dull story with no love in it, which makes up the life
      of many a woman, the son is the hero and the principal character. To her
      beloved Paul, especially since he had reached manhood, Madame Astier owed
      the only genuine emotions of her life, the delightful anguish of the
      waiting, the chill in the pale cheeks and the heat in the hollow of the
      hand, the supernatural intuitions which, before the carriage is at the
      door, give the infallible warning that &lsquo;he comes,&rsquo;&mdash;things which she
      had never known even in the early years of her married life or in the days
      when people called her imprudent, and her husband used to say with
      simplicity, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s odd; I never smoke, and my wife&rsquo;s veils smell of
      tobacco.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When she reached her son&rsquo;s, and the first pull of the bell was not
      answered, her anxiety rose to distraction. The little mansion showed no
      sign of life from the ground to the ornamental roof-ridge, and, in spite
      of its much-admired style, had to her eyes a sinister appearance, as also
      had the adjoining lodging-house, not less architecturally admirable, but
      showing bills all along the high mullioned windows of its two upper
      storeys, &lsquo;To let; To let; To let.&rsquo; At the second pull, which produced a
      tremendous ring, Stenne, the impudent little man-servant, looking very
      spruce in his close-fitting sky-blue livery, appeared at last at the door,
      rather confused and hesitating: &lsquo;Oh yes, M. Paul was in, but&mdash;but&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy mother, haunted ever since yesterday by the same horrible
      idea, pictured her son lying in his blood, crossed at a bound the passage
      and three steps, and burst breathless into the study. Paul was standing at
      work before his desk in the bay window. One pane of the stained glass was
      open, to throw light upon the half-finished sketch and the box of colours,
      while the rest of the perfumed apartment was steeped in a soft subdued
      glow. Absorbed in his work he seemed not to have heard the carriage stop,
      the bell ring twice, and a lady&rsquo;s dress flit along the passage. He had:
      but it was not his mother&rsquo;s shabby black dress that he expected, it was
      not for her that he posed at his desk, nor for her that he had provided
      the delicate bouquets of fine irises and tulips, or the sweetmeats and
      elegant decanters upon the light table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way in which as he looked round he said, &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you,&rsquo; would have
      been significant to anyone but his mother. She did not notice it, lost in
      the delight of seeing him there, perfectly well, perfectly dressed. She
      said not a word, but tearing her glove open she triumphantly handed him
      the cheque. He did not ask her where she got it, or what she had given for
      it, but put his arms round her, taking care not to crumple the paper.
      &lsquo;Dear old Mum&rsquo;; that was all he said, but it was enough for her, though
      her child was not as overjoyed as she expected, but rather embarrassed.
      &lsquo;Where are you going next?&rsquo; he said thoughtfully, with the cheque in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where next?&rsquo; she repeated, looking at him with disappointment. Why, she
      had only just come, and made certain of spending a few minutes with him;
      but she could go if she was in the way. &lsquo;Why, I think I shall go to the
      Princess&rsquo;s. But I am in no hurry; she wearies me with her everlasting
      lamentation for Herbert. You think she has done with it, and then it takes
      a fresh start.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul was on the point of saying something, which he did not say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Mammy, will you do something for me? I am expecting
      somebody. Go and cash this for me, and let the agent have the money in
      return for my drafts. You don&rsquo;t mind?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not indeed. If she went about his business she would seem to be
      with him still. While he was signing his name, the mother looked round the
      room. There were charming carpets and curtains, and nothing to mark the
      profession of the occupant except an X ruler in old walnut, and some casts
      from well-known friezes hung here and there. As she thought of her recent
      agony and looked at the elaborate bouquets and the refreshments laid by
      the sofa, it occurred to her that these were unusual preparations for a
      suicide. She smiled without any resentment. The naughty wretch! She only
      pointed with her parasol at the bonbons in the box and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those are to make a hole in your&mdash;your&mdash;what do you call it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to laugh too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a great change since yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business, you know, the big thing I talked to you about, is really
      coming off this time, I think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really? So is mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh? Ah yes, Sammy&rsquo;s marriage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Their pretty cunning eyes, both of the same hard grey, but, the mother&rsquo;s a
      little faded, exchanged one scrutinising glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll see, we shall be rolling in riches,&rsquo; he said after a moment. &lsquo;Now
      you must be going,&rsquo; and he hurried her gently to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning Paul had had a note from the Princess to say that she should
      call for him at his own house to go to the usual place. The usual place
      was the cemetery. Lately there had been what Madame Astier called &lsquo;a fresh
      start&rsquo; of Herbert. Twice a week the widow went to the cemetery with
      flowers, or tapers, or articles for the chapel, and urged the progress of
      the work; her conjugal feelings had broken out again. The fact was, that
      after a long and painful hesitation between her vanity and her love, the
      temptation of keeping her title and the fascinations of the delightful
      Paul&mdash;a hesitation the more painful that she confided it to no one,
      except in her journal every evening to &lsquo;poor Herbert&rsquo;&mdash;the
      appointment of Sammy had finally decided her, and she thought it proper,
      before taking a new husband, to complete the sepulture of the first and
      have done with the mausoleum and the dangerous intimacy of its seductive
      designer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul, without understanding the flutterings of the foolish little soul,
      was amused by them, and thought them excellent symptoms, indicating the
      approach of the crisis. But the thing dragged, and he was in a hurry; it
      was time to hasten the conclusion and profit by Colette&rsquo;s visit, which had
      been long proposed but long deferred, the Princess, though curious to see
      the young man&rsquo;s lodgings, being apparently afraid to meet him in a place
      much more private than her own house or her carriage, where there were
      always the servants to see. Not that he had ever been over-bold; he only
      seemed to surround her with his presence. But she was afraid of herself,
      her opinion coinciding with that of the young man, who, being an
      experienced general in such matters, had classed her at once as one of the
      &lsquo;open towns.&rsquo; It was his name for the sort of fashionable women who, in
      spite of a high and apparently unassailable position, in spite of a great
      apparatus of defences in every direction, are in reality to be carried by
      a bold attack. He did not intend now to make the regular assault, but only
      a smart approach or so of warm flirtation, sufficient to set a mark upon
      his prey without hurting her dignity, and to signify the final
      expropriation of the deceased. The marriage and the million would follow
      in due time. Such was the happy dream which Madame Astier had interrupted.
      He was pursuing it still, at the same desk and in the same contemplative
      attitude, when the whole house resounded with another ring at the bell,
      followed however only by conversation at the front door. &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; 
      said Paul impatiently, as he came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of a footman, whose tall black figure was conspicuous in the
      doorway against a background of splashing rain, answered from the steps,
      with respectful insolence, that my lady was waiting for him in the
      carriage. Paul, though choking with rage, managed to get out the words, &lsquo;I
      am coming,&rsquo; But what horrid curses he muttered under his breath! The dead
      fellow again! Sure enough, it was the remembrance of him that had kept her
      away. But after a few seconds the hope of avenging himself before long in
      a highly amusing way enabled him so far to recover countenance, that when
      he joined the Princess he was as cool as ever, and showed nothing of his
      anger but a little extra paleness in the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was warm in the brougham, the windows having been put up because of the
      shower. Huge bouquets of violets and wreaths as heavy as pies loaded the
      cushions round Madame de Rosen and filled her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are the flowers unpleasant? Shall I put the window down?&rsquo; said she, with
      the cajoling manner which a woman puts on when she has played you a trick
      and wants not to have a quarrel over it. Paul&rsquo;s gesture expressed a
      dignified indifference. It was nothing to him whether the window was put
      down or put up. The Princess, whose deep veil, still worn on such
      occasions as the present, concealed a blooming face, felt more
      uncomfortable than if he had reproached her openly. Poor young man! She
      was treating him so cruelly&mdash;so much more cruelly than he knew! She
      laid her hand gently upon his, and said, &lsquo;You are not angry with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He? Not at all. Why should he be angry with her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For not coming in. I did say I would, but at the last moment I&mdash;I
      did not think I should hurt you so much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You hurt me very much indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When a gentleman of severely correct deportment is betrayed into a word or
      two of emotion, oh, what an impression they make upon a woman&rsquo;s heart!
      They upset her almost as much as the tears of an officer in uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;please, please do not distress yourself any more
      about me. Please say that you are not angry now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she leaned quite close to him, letting her flowers slip down.
      She felt quite safe with two broad black backs and two black cockades
      visible on the box under a large umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look,&rsquo; she went on; &lsquo;I promise you to come once&mdash;at least once&mdash;before&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
      but here she stopped in dismay. Carried away by her feelings, she was on
      the point of telling him that they were soon to part, and that she was
      going to St. Petersburg. Recovering herself in a moment, she declared
      emphatically that she would call unannounced some afternoon when she was
      not going to visit the mausoleum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you go there every afternoon,&rsquo; he said, with clenched teeth and such
      a queer accent of suppressed indignation that a smile played beneath the
      widow&rsquo;s veil, and to make a diversion she put down the window. The shower
      was over. The brougham had turned into a poor quarter, where the street in
      its squalid gaiety seemed to feel that the worst of the year was past, as
      the sun, almost hot enough for summer, lighted up the wretched shops, the
      barrows at the gutter&rsquo;s edge, the tawdry placards, and the rags that
      fluttered in the windows. The Princess looked out upon it with
      indifference. Such trivialities are non-existent for people accustomed to
      see them from the cushions of their carriage at an elevation of two feet
      from the road. The comfort of the springs and the protection of the glass
      have a peculiar influence upon the eyes, which take no interest in things
      below their level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Rosen was thinking, &lsquo;How he loves me! And how nice he is!&rsquo; The
      other suitor was of course more dignified, but it would have been much
      pleasanter with this one. Oh, dear! The happiest life is but a service
      incomplete, and never a perfect set!
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they were nearing the cemetery. On both sides of the road
      were stonemasons&rsquo; yards, in which the hard white of slabs, images, and
      crosses mingled with the gold of <i>immortelles</i> and the black or white
      beads of wreaths and memorials.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what about Védrine&rsquo;s statue? Which way do we decide?&rsquo; he asked
      abruptly, in the tone of a man who means to confine himself to business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, really&mdash;&rsquo; she began. &lsquo;But, oh dear, oh dear, I shall hurt your
      feelings again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My feelings! how so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before, they had been to make a last inspection of the knight,
      before he was sent to the foundry. At a previous visit the Princess had
      received a disagreeable impression, not so much from Védrine&rsquo;s work, which
      she scarcely looked at, as from the strange studio with trees growing in
      it, with lizards and wood-lice running about the walls, and all around it
      roofless ruins, suggesting recollections of the incendiary mob. But from
      the second visit the poor little woman had come back literally ill. &lsquo;My
      dear, it is the horror of horrors!&rsquo; Such was her real opinion, as given
      the same evening to Madame Astier. But she did not dare to say so to Paul,
      knowing that he was a friend of the sculptor, and also because the name of
      Védrine is one of the two or three which the fashionable world has chosen
      to honour in spite of its natural and implanted tastes, and regards with
      an irrational admiration by way of pretending to artistic originality.
      That the coarse rude figure should not be put on dear Herbert&rsquo;s tomb she
      was determined, but she was at a loss for a presentable reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, Monsieur Paul, between ourselves&mdash;of course it is a splendid
      work&mdash;a fine <i>Védrine</i>&mdash;but you must allow that it is a
      little <i>triste!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but for a tomb&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; suggested Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then, if you will not mind, there is this.&rsquo; With much hesitation she
      came to the point. Really, you know, a man upon a camp bedstead with
      nothing on! Really she did not think it fit. It might be taken for a
      portrait!&rsquo; And just think of poor Herbert, the correctest of men! What
      would it look like?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a good deal in that,&rsquo; said Paul gravely, and he threw his friend
      Védrine overboard with as little concern as a litter of kittens. &lsquo;After
      all, if you do not like the figure, we can put another, or none at all. It
      would have a more striking effect. The tent empty; the bed ready, and no
      one to lie on it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess, whose chief satisfaction was that the shirtless ruffian
      would not be seen there, exclaimed, &lsquo;Oh, how glad I am! how nice of you! I
      don&rsquo;t mind telling you now, that I cried over it all night!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual, when they stopped at the entrance gate, the footman took the
      wreaths and followed some way behind, while Colette and Paul climbed in
      the heat a path made soft by the recent showers. She leaned upon his arm,
      and from time to time &lsquo;hoped that she did not tire him.&rsquo; He shook his head
      with a sad smile. There were few people in the cemetery. A gardener and a
      keeper recognised the familiar figure of the Princess with a respectful
      bow. But when they had left the avenue and passed the upper terraces, it
      was all solitude and shade. Besides the birds in the trees they heard only
      the grinding of the saw and the metallic clink of the chisel, sounds
      perpetual in Père-la-Chaise, as in some city always in building and never
      finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three times Madame de Rosen had seen her companion glance with
      displeasure at the tall lacquey in his long black overcoat and cockade,
      whose funereal figure now as ever formed part of the love-scene. Eager on
      this occasion to please him, she stopped, saying, &lsquo;Wait a minute,&rsquo; took
      the flowers herself, dismissed the servant, and they went on all alone
      along the winding walk. But in spite of this kindness, Paul&rsquo;s brow did not
      relax; and, as he had hung upon his free arm three or four rings of
      violets, <i>immortelles</i>, and lilac, he felt more angry with the
      deceased than ever. &lsquo;You shall pay me for this,&rsquo; was his savage
      reflection. She, on the contrary, felt singularly happy, in that vivid
      consciousness of life and health which comes upon us in places of death.
      Perhaps it was the warmth of the day, the perfume of the flowers, mixing
      their fragrance with the stronger scent of the yews and the box trees and
      the moist earth steaming in the sun, and with another yet, an acrid,
      faint, and penetrating scent, which she knew well, but which, to-day,
      instead of revolting her senses, as usual, seemed rather to intoxicate
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a shiver passed over her. The hand which lay on the young man&rsquo;s
      arm was suddenly grasped in his, grasped with force and held tight, held
      as it were in an embrace, and the little hand dared not take itself away.
      The fingers of his hand were trying to get between the delicate fingers of
      hers and take possession of it altogether. Hers resisted, trying to clench
      itself in the glove by way of refusal. All the time they went on walking,
      arm in arm, neither speaking nor looking, but much moved, resistance,
      according to the natural law, exciting the relative desire. At last came
      the surrender; the little hand opened, and their fingers joined in a clasp
      which parted their gloves, for one exquisite moment of full avowal and
      complete possession. The next minute the woman&rsquo;s pride awoke. She wanted
      to speak, to show that she was mistress of herself, that she had no part
      in what was done, nor knowledge of it at all. Finding nothing to say, she
      read aloud the epitaph on a tomb lying flat among the weeds, &lsquo;Augusta,
      1847,&rsquo; and he continued, under his breath, &lsquo;A love-story, no doubt.&rsquo; 
      Overhead the thrushes and finches uttered their strident notes, not unlike
      the sounds of the stone-cutting, which were heard uninterruptedly in the
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now entering the Twentieth Division, the part of the cemetery
      which may be called its &lsquo;old town,&rsquo; where the paths are narrower, the
      trees higher, the tombs closer together, a confused mass of ironwork,
      pillars, Greek temples, pyramids, angels, genii, busts, wings open and
      wings folded. The tombs were various as the lives now hidden beneath&mdash;commonplace,
      odd, original, simple, forced, pretentious, modest. In some the
      floor-stones were freshly cleaned and loaded with flowers, memorials, and
      miniature gardens of a Chinese elegance in littleness. In others the mossy
      slabs were mouldering or parting, and were covered with brambles and high
      weeds. But all bore well-known names, names distinctly Parisian, names of
      lawyers, judges, merchants of eminence, ranged here in rows as in the
      haunts of business and trade. There were even double names, standing for
      family partnerships in capital and connection, substantial signatures,
      known no more to the directory or the bank ledger, but united for ever
      upon the tomb. And Madame de Rosen remarked them with the same tone of
      surprise, almost of pleasure, with which she would have bowed to a
      carriage in the Park, &lsquo;Ah! the So-and-So&rsquo;s! Mario? was that the singer?&rsquo; 
      and so forth, all by way of seeming not to know that their hands were
      clasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      But presently the door of a tomb near them creaked, and there appeared a
      large lady in black, with a round fresh face. She carried a little
      watering-pot, and was putting to rights the flower-beds, oratory, and tomb
      generally, as calmly as if she had been in a summer-house. She nodded to
      them across the Enclosure with a kindly smile of unselfish good will,
      which seemed to say, &lsquo;Use your time, happy lovers; life is short, and
      nothing good but love.&rsquo; A feeling of embarrassment unloosed their hands.
      The spell was broken, and the Princess, with a sort of shame, led the way
      across the tombs, taking the quickest and shortest line to reach the
      mausoleum of the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      It stood on the highest ground in &lsquo;Division 20,&rsquo; upon a large level of
      lawn and flowers, inclosed by a low rich rail of wrought iron in the style
      of the Scaliger tombs at Verona. Its general appearance was designedly
      rough, and fairly realised the conception of an antique tent with its
      coarse folds, the red of the Dalmatian granite giving the colour of the
      bark in which the canvas had been steeped. At the top of three broad steps
      of granite was the entrance, flanked with pedestals and high funereal
      tripods of bronze blackened with a sort of lacquer. Above were the Rosen
      arms upon a large scutcheon, also of bronze, the shield of the good knight
      who slept within the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the inclosure, they laid the wreaths here and there, on the
      pedestals and on the slanted projections, representing huge tent-pegs, at
      the edge of the base. The Princess went to the far end of the interior,
      where in the darkness before the altar shone the silver fringes of two
      kneeling-desks, and the old gold of a Gothic cross and massive
      candlesticks, and there fell upon her knees&mdash;a good place to pray in,
      among the cool slabs, the panels of black marble glittering with the name
      and full titles of the dead, and the inscriptions from Ecclesiastes or the
      Song of Songs. But the Princess could find only a few indistinct words,
      confused with profane thoughts, which made her ashamed. She rose and
      busied herself with the flower-stands, retiring gradually far enough to
      judge the effect of the sarcophagus or bed. The cushion of black bronze,
      with silver monogram, was already in its place, and she thought the hard
      couch with nothing upon it had a fine and simple effect. But she wanted
      the opinion of Paul, who could be heard pacing the gravel as he waited
      without. Mentally approving his delicacy, she was on the point of calling
      him in, when the interior grew dark, and on the trefoil lights of the
      lantern was heard the patter of another shower. Twice she called him, but
      he did not move from the pedestal, where he sat exposed to the rain, and
      without speaking declined her invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;come in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he stayed, saying rapidly and low, &lsquo;I do not want to come. You love
      him so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; she still said, &lsquo;come/ and taking his hand drew him to the
      entrance. Step by step the splashing of the rain made them draw back as
      far as the sarcophagus, and there, half sitting, half standing, they
      remained side by side, contemplating beneath the low clouds the &lsquo;old town&rsquo; 
      of the dead, which sloped away at their feet with its crowding throng of
      pinnacles and grey figures and humbler stones, rising like Druid
      architecture from the bright green. No birds were audible, no sound of
      tools, nothing but the water running away on all sides, and from the
      canvas cover of a half-finished monument the monotonous voices of two
      artisans discussing their worries. The rain without made it all the warmer
      within, and with the strong aroma of the flowers mingled still that other
      inseparable scent The Princess had raised her veil, feeling the same
      oppression and dryness of the mouth that she had felt on the way up.
      Speechless and motionless, the pair seemed so much a part of the tomb,
      that a little brown, bird came hopping in to shake its feathers and pick a
      worm between the slabs. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a nightingale,&rsquo; murmured Paul in the sweet
      overpowering stillness. She tried to say, &lsquo;Do they sing still in this
      month?&rsquo; But he had taken her in his arms, he had set her between his knees
      at the edge of the granite couch, and putting her head back, pressed upon
      her half-open lips a long, long kiss, passionately returned.

    </div>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because love is more strong than death,&rsquo; said the inscription from the
      Canticle, written above them upon the marble wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Princess reached her house, where Madame Astier was awaiting her
      return, she had a long cry in the arms of her friend, a refuge unhappily
      not more trustworthy than those of her friend&rsquo;s son. It was a burst of
      lamentation and broken words. &lsquo;Oh, my dear, oh, my dear, how miserable I
      am! If you knew,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;if you only knew!&rsquo; She felt with despair the
      hopeless difficulty of the situation, her hand solemnly promised to the
      Prince d&rsquo;Athis, and her affections just plighted to the enchanter of the
      tombs, whom she cursed from the depths of her soul. And, most distressing
      of all, she could not confide her weakness to her affectionate friend,
      being sure that, the moment she opened her lips, the mother would side
      with her son against &lsquo;Sammy,&rsquo; with love against prudence, and perhaps even
      compel her to the intolerable degradation of marrying a commoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There then, there then,&rsquo; said Madame Astier, unaffected by the torrent of
      grief. &lsquo;You are come from the cemetery, I suppose, where you have been
      working up your feelings again. But you know, dear, there must be an end
      to <i>Artemisia!</i>&rsquo; She understood the woman&rsquo;s weak vanity, and insisted
      on the absurdity of this interminable mourning, ridiculous in the eyes of
      the world, and at all events injurious to her beauty And after all, it was
      not a question of a second love-match! What was proposed was no more than
      an alliance between two names and titles equally noble. Herbert himself,
      if he saw her from heaven, must be content.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He did understand things, certainly, poor dear,&rsquo; sighed Colette de Rosen,
      whose maiden name was Sauvadon. She was set on becoming &lsquo;Madame
      l&rsquo;Ambassadrice,&rsquo; and still more on remaining &lsquo;Madame la Princesse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look, dear, will you have a piece of good advice? You just run away.
      Sammy will start in a week. Do not wait for him. Take Lavaux. He knows St.
      Petersburg, and will settle you there meanwhile. And there will be this
      advantage, that you will escape a painful scene with the Duchess. A
      Corsican, you know, is capable of anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye-es, perhaps I had better go,&rsquo; said Madame de Rosen, to whom the chief
      merit of the plan was that she would avoid any fresh attack, and put
      distance between her and the folly of the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it the tomb?&rsquo; asked Madame Astier, seeing her hesitate. &lsquo;Is that it?
      Why, Paul will finish it very well without you. Come, pet, no more tears.
      You may water your beauty, but you must not over-water it.&rsquo; As she went
      away in the fading light to wait for her omnibus, the good lady said to
      herself, &lsquo;Oh dear, D&rsquo;Athis will never know what his marriage is costing
      me!&rsquo; And here her feeling of weariness, her longing for a good rest after
      so many trials, reminded her suddenly that the most trying of all was to
      come, the discovery and confession at home. She had not yet had time to
      think about it, and now she was going fast towards it, nearer and nearer
      with every turn of the heavy wheels. The very anticipation made her
      shudder: it was not fear; but the frantic outcries of Astier-Réhu, his big
      rough voice, the answer that must be given, and then the inevitable
      reappearance of his trunk&mdash;oh, what a weariness it would be! Could it
      not be put off till to-morrow? She was tempted not to confess at once, but
      to turn suspicion upon some one else, upon Teyssèdre for instance, till
      the next morning. She would at least get a quiet night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, here is Madame! Something has happened/ cried Corentine, as she ran
      to the door in a fluster, excitement making more conspicuous than usual
      the marks of her smallpox. Madame Astier made straight for her own room;
      but the door of the study opened, and a peremptory &lsquo;Adelaide!&rsquo; compelled
      her to go in. The rays of the lamp-globe showed her that the face of her
      husband had a strange expression. He took her by the two hands and drew
      her into the light. Then in a quivering voice he said, &lsquo;Loi-sillon is
      dead,&rsquo; and he kissed her on both cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not found out! No, not yet. He had not even gone up to his papers; but had
      been pacing his study for two hours, eager to see her and tell her this
      great news, these three words which meant a change in their whole life,
      &lsquo;Loisillon is dead!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
            Mlle. Germaine de Freydet,

                          Clos Jallanges.
</pre>
    <p>
      My DEAREST SISTER,&mdash;Your letters distress me much. I know you are
      lonely and ill, and feel my absence; but what am I to do? Remember my
      master&rsquo;s advice to show myself and be seen. It is not, as you may suppose,
      at Clos Jallanges, in my tweed suit and leggings, that I could get on with
      my candidature. I cannot but see that the time is near. Loisillon is
      sinking visibly, dying by inches; and I am using the time to make
      friendships among the Academicians, which may mean votes hereafter. Astier
      has already introduced me to several of them. I often go to fetch him
      after the meetings. It is charming to see them come out of the Institute,
      almost all laden with years as with honours, and walk away arm-in-arm in
      groups of three or four, bright and happy, talking loud and filling the
      pavement, their eyes still wet after the hearty laughs they have had
      within. &lsquo;Paille-ron is very smart,&rsquo; says one; &lsquo;But Danjou gave it him
      back,&rsquo; says another. As for me, I fasten on to the arm of Astier-Réhu and,
      ranked with the deities, seem almost a deity myself. One by one at this or
      that bridge the groups break up. &lsquo;See you next Thursday,&rsquo; is the last
      word. And I go back to the Rue de Beaune with my master, who gives me
      encouragement and advice, and in the confidence of success says, with his
      frank laugh, &lsquo;Look at me, Freydet; I am twenty years younger after a
      meeting!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I really believe the dome does keep them fresh. Where is there another old
      man as lusty as Jean Réhu, whose ninety-eighth birthday we celebrated
      yesterday evening by a dinner at Voisin&rsquo;s? Lavaux suggested it, and if it
      cost me 40L., it gave me the opportunity of counting my men. We were
      twenty-five at table, all Academicians, except Picheral, Lavaux, and
      myself. I have the votes of seventeen or eighteen; the rest are uncertain,
      but well disposed. Dinner very well served, and very chatty.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, I have asked Lavaux to come to Clos Jallanges for his holiday.
      He is librarian of the Bibliothèque Mazarine. He shall have the large room
      in the wing, looking out on the pheasants. I don&rsquo;t think highly of his
      character, but I must have him; he is the Duchess&rsquo;s &lsquo;zebra&rsquo;! Did I tell
      you that a zebra in ladies&rsquo; language is a bachelor friend, unoccupied,
      discreet, and quick, kept always at hand for errands and missions too
      delicate to be trusted to a servant? In the intervals of his diplomacy a
      young zebra may sometimes get particular gratifications, but as a rule the
      animal is tame and wants little, content with small promotion, a place at
      the bottom of the table, and the honour of showing his paces before the
      lady and her friends. Lavaux, I fancy, has made his place profitable in
      other ways. He is so clever and, in spite of his easy manner, so much
      dreaded. He knows, as he says, &lsquo;the servants&rsquo; hall&rsquo; of two establishments,
      literature and politics, and he shows me the holes and traps of which the
      road to the Institute is full. Astier, my master, does not know them to
      this day. In his grand simplicity he has climbed straight up, unaware of
      danger, with his eyes upon the dome, confident in his strength and his
      labour. A hundred times he would have broken his neck, if his wife, the
      cleverest of clever women, had not guided him unperceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Lavaux who dissuaded me from publishing between this and the next
      vacancy my &lsquo;Thoughts of a Rustic.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said he to me, &lsquo;you have done
      enough. You might well even let it be understood that you will not write
      any more. Your work is over, and you are a mere gentleman at large. The
      Académie loves that.&rsquo; I put that with the valuable hint from Picheral: &lsquo;Do
      not take them your books.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fewer your works, I see, the better your claim. Picheral has much
      influence; he too must come to us this summer. Put him on the second
      floor, in what was the box-room, or somewhere. Poor Germaine, it is a
      great bother for you, and ill as you are! But where&rsquo;s the help? It is bad
      enough not to have a house in town for the winter and give parties, like
      Dalzon, Moser, and all my competitors. Do, do take care of yourself and
      get well.
    </p>
    <p>
      To go back to my dinner party. There was naturally much talk of the
      Académie, its elections and duties, its merits and demerits in public
      estimation. The &lsquo;deities&rsquo; hold that those who run down the institution are
      all, without exception, poor creatures who cannot get in. For the strong
      apparent instances to the contrary, there was a reason in each case. I
      ventured to mention the great name of Balzac, a man from our country. But
      the playwright Desminières, who used to manage the amateur theatricals at
      Compiègne, burst out with &lsquo;Balzac! But did you know him? Do you know, sir,
      the sort of man he was? An utter Bohemian! A man, sir, who never had a
      guinea in his pocket! I had it from his friend Frédéric Lemaître. Never
      one guinea! And you would have had the Académie&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; Here old
      Jean Réhu, having his trumpet to his ear, got the notion that we were
      talking of &lsquo;tallies,&rsquo; and told us the fine story of his friend Suard
      coming to the Académie on January 21, 1793, the day the king was executed,
      and availing himself of the absence of his colleagues to sweep off the
      whole fees for the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tells a story well, does the old gentleman, and but for his deafness
      would be a brilliant talker. When I gave his health, with a few
      complimentary verses on his marvellous youth, the old fellow in a gracious
      reply called me his dear colleague. My master Astier corrected him&mdash;&lsquo;future
      colleague.&rsquo; Laughter and applause. &lsquo;Future colleague&rsquo; was the title which
      they all gave me as they said goodbye, shaking my hand with a significant
      pressure, and adding, &lsquo;We shall meet before long,&rsquo; or &lsquo;See you soon,&rsquo; in
      reference to my expected call. It is not a pleasant process, paying these
      calls, but everyone goes through it. Astier-Réhu told me, as we came away
      from the dinner, that when he was elected old Dufaure let him come ten
      times without seeing him. Well, he would not give up, and the eleventh
      time the door was thrown open. Nothing like persistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, if Ripault-Babin or Loisillon died (they are both in danger, but
      even now I have most hopes of Ripault-Babin), my only serious competitor
      would be Dalzon. He has talent and wealth, stands well with the &lsquo;dukes,&rsquo; 
      and his cellar is capital; the only thing against him is a youthful
      peccadillo lately discovered, &lsquo;Without the Veil,&rsquo; a poem of 600 lines
      printed &lsquo;at Eropolis,&rsquo; anonymously, and utterly outrageous. They say that
      he has bought up and suppressed the whole, but there are still some copies
      in circulation with signature and dedication. Poor Dalzon contradicts the
      story and makes a desperate fight. The Académie reserves judgment pending
      the inquiry. That is why my respected master said to me gravely one
      evening without giving reasons, &lsquo;I shall not vote again for M. Dalzon.&rsquo; 
      The Académie is a club, that is the important thing to remember. You
      cannot go in without proper dress and clean hands. For all that I have too
      much gallantry and too much respect for my opponent to make use of such
      concealed weapons; and Fage, the bookbinder in the Cour des Comptes, the
      strange little humpback whom I sometimes meet in Védrine&rsquo;s studio&mdash;Fage,
      I say, who has much acquaintance with the curiosities of bibliography, got
      a good snub when he offered me one of the signed copies of &lsquo;Without the
      Veil.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then it will go to M. Moser,&rsquo; was his calm reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talking of Védrine, I am in an awkward position. In the warmth of our
      first few meetings I made him promise to bring his family to stay with us
      in the country. But how can we have him along with people like Astier and
      Lavaux, who detest him? He is so uncivilised, such an oddity! Just
      imagine! He is by descent Marquis de Védrine, but even at school he
      suppressed the title and the &lsquo;de,&rsquo; additions coveted by most people in
      this democratic age, when everything else may be got. And what is his
      reason? Because, do you see, he wants to be liked for his own sake! The
      latest of him is that the Princess de Rosen will not take the knight,
      which he has done for the Prince&rsquo;s tomb. It was mentioned every minute in
      the family, where money is not plenty. &lsquo;When we have sold the knight, I am
      to have a clockwork horse,&rsquo; said the boy. The poor mother too counted upon
      the knight for refurnishing her empty presses, and to Védrine himself the
      price of the master-piece meant just three months&rsquo; holiday in a Nile-boat.
      Well! the knight not sold, or to be paid for heaven knows when, after a
      lawsuit and a valuation, if you fancy they are thrown out by that, you are
      much mistaken. When I got to the Cour des Comptes the day after the
      disappointment, I found friend Védrine planted before an easel, absorbed
      in pleasure, sketching upon a large canvas the curious wild vegetation on
      the burnt building. Behind him were his wife and son in ecstasy, and
      Madame Védrine, with the little girl in her arms, said to me in a serious
      undertone, &lsquo;We are so happy; Monsieur Védrine has at last got to oils.&rsquo; Is
      it not laughable? Is it not touching?
    </p>
    <p>
      This piecemeal letter, dear, will show you in what a bustle and fever I
      live since I have been working at my candidature. I go here and go there,
      to &lsquo;at homes,&rsquo; to dinner parties, to evening parties. I am even supposed
      to be &lsquo;zebra&rsquo; to good Madame Ancelin, because I am constant at her
      drawing-room on Fridays, and on Tuesday evenings in her box at the
      Français. A very countrified &lsquo;zebra,&rsquo; I am sure, in spite of the changes I
      have had made to give myself a graver and more fashionable appearance. You
      must look for a surprise when I come back. Last Monday there was a select
      party at the Duchess Padovani&rsquo;s, where I had the honour to be presented to
      the Grand-Duke Leopold. His Highness complimented me on my last book, and
      all my books, which he knows as well as I do. It is marvellous what
      foreigners do know. But it is at the Astiers&rsquo; that I am most comfortable.
      It is such a primitive, simple, united family. One day, after breakfast,
      there arrived a new Academic coat for the master, and we tried it on
      together. I say &lsquo;we,&rsquo; for he wanted to see how the palm leaves looked upon
      me. I put on the coat, hat, and sword, a real sword, my dear, which comes
      out, and has a groove in the middle for the blood to run away, and I
      assure you I was struck with my appearance; but this I tell you only to
      show the intimacy of this invaluable friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I come back to my peaceful, if narrow, quarters, if it is too late to
      write to you, I always do a little counting. On the full list of the
      Académie I tick those of whom I am sure, and those who stand by Dalzon.
      Then I do various sums in subtraction and addition. It is an excellent
      amusement, as you will see when I show you. As I was telling you, Dalzon
      has the &lsquo;dukes,&rsquo; but the writer of the &lsquo;House of Orleans,&rsquo; who is received
      at Chantilly, is to introduce me there before long. If I get on there&mdash;and
      with this object I am diligently studying a certain engagement at Rocroy;
      so you see your brother is becoming deep&mdash;well, if I get on, the
      author of &lsquo;Without the Veil, printed at Eropolis,&rsquo; loses his strongest
      support. As for my opinions, I do not disavow them. I am a Republican, but
      not extreme, and more particularly I am a Candidate! Immediately after
      this little expedition I quite expect to come back to my darling Germaine,
      who will, I do hope, bear up and think of the happiness of the triumph! We
      will do it, dear! We will get into the &lsquo;goose&rsquo;s garden,&rsquo; as it is called
      by that Bohemian Védrine; but we shall need endurance.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             Your loving brother,

                          Abel de Freydet.

      I have opened my letter again to say that the morning papers announce the
      death of Loisillon. The stroke of fate is always affecting, even when
      fully expected. What a sad event! What a loss to French literature! And
      unhappily, dear, it will keep me here still longer. Please pay the
      labourers. More news soon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      DESTINY had willed that Loisillon, fortunate always, should be fortunate
      in dying at the right moment. A week later, when houses were closed,
      society broken up, the Chamber and the Institute not sitting, his funeral
      train would have been composed of Academicians attentive to their tallies,
      followed only by deputies from the numerous societies of which he was
      Secretary or President. But business-like to the last and after, he went
      off to the moment, just before the Grand Prix, choosing a week entirely
      blank, when, as there was no crime, or duel, or interesting lawsuit, or
      political event, the sensational obsequies of the Permanent Secretary
      would be the only pastime of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funeral mass was to be at twelve o&rsquo;clock, and long before that hour an
      immense crowd was gathering round St. Germain des Prés. The traffic was
      stopped, and no carriages but those of persons invited were allowed to
      pass within the rails, strictly kept by a line of policemen posted at
      intervals. Who Loisillon was, what he had done in his seventy years&rsquo; 
      sojourn among mankind, what was the meaning of the capital letter
      embroidered in silver on the funeral drapery, was known to but few in the
      crowd. The one thing which struck them was the arrangement of the
      protecting line, and the large space left to the dead, distance, room, and
      emptiness being the constant symbols of respect and grandeur. It had been
      understood that there would be a chance of seeing actresses and persons of
      notoriety, and the cockneys at a distance were putting names to the faces
      they recognised among the groups conversing in front of the church.
    </p>

    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/164.jpg" width="100%"
       alt="There, Under the Black-draped Porch 164 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      There, under the black-draped porch, was the place for hearing the true
      funeral oration on Loisillon, quite other than that which was to be
      delivered presently at Mont Parnasse, and the true article on the man and
      his work, very different from the notices ready for to-morrow&rsquo;s
      newspapers. His work was a &lsquo;Journey in Val d&rsquo;Andorre,&rsquo; and two reports
      published at the National Press, relating to the time when he was
      Superintendent at the Beaux-Arts. The man was a sort of shrewd attorney,
      creeping and cringing, with a permanent bow and an apologetic attitude,
      which seemed to ask your pardon for his decorations, your pardon for his
      insignia, your pardon for his place in the Académie&mdash;where his
      experience as a man of business was useful in fusing together a number of
      different elements, with none of which he could well have been classed&mdash;your
      pardon for the amazing success which had raised so high such a worthless
      winged grub. It was remembered that at an official dinner he had said of
      himself complacently, as he bustled round the table with a napkin on his
      arm, &lsquo;What an excellent servant I should have made!&rsquo; And it might have
      been written on his tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while they moralised upon the nothingness of his life, his corpse, the
      remains of nothing, was receiving the honours of death. Carriage after
      carriage drew up at the church; liveries brown and liveries blue came and
      disappeared; long-frocked footmen bowed to the pavement with a pompous
      banging of doors and steps; the groups of journalists respectfully made
      way, now for the Duchess Padovani, stately and proud, now for Madame
      Ancelin, blooming in her crape, now for Madame Eviza, whose Jewish eyes
      shone through her veil with blaze enough to attract a constable&mdash;all
      the ladies of the Académie, assembled in full congregation to practise
      their worship, not so much by a service to the memory of Loisillon, as by
      contemplation of their living idols, the &lsquo;deities&rsquo; made and fashioned by
      the cunning of their little hands, the work upon which, as women, they had
      employed the superabundance of their energy, artfulness, ambition, and
      pride. Some actresses had come too, on the pretext that the deceased had
      been the president of some sort of Actors&rsquo; Orphanage, but moved in reality
      by the frantic determination &lsquo;not to be out of it,&rsquo; which belongs to their
      class. Their expressions of woe were such that they might have been taken
      for near relations. A carriage suddenly drawing up set down a distracted
      group of black veils, whose sorrow was distressing to witness. The widow,
      at last? No, it is Marguerite Oger, the great sensational actress, whose
      appearance excites all round the square a prolonged stir and much pushing
      about. From the porch a journalist ran forward to meet her, and taking her
      hands besought her to bear up. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I ought to be calm; I
      will,&rsquo; Whereupon, drying her tears and forcing them back with her
      handkerchief, she entered, or it should rather be said &lsquo;went on,&rsquo; into the
      darkness of the nave, with its background of glimmering tapers, fell down
      before a desk on the ladies&rsquo; side in a prostration of self-abandonment,
      and rising with a sorrowful air said to another actress at her side, &lsquo;How
      much did they take at the Vaudeville last night?&rsquo; &lsquo;168L. 18s.,&rsquo; answered
      her friend, with the same accent of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lost in the crowd at the edge of the square, Abel de Freydet heard the
      people round him say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Marguerite. How well she did it!&rsquo; But being a
      small man, he was trying in vain to make his way, when a hand was laid
      upon his shoulder. &lsquo;What, still in Paris? It must be a trial for your poor
      sister,&rsquo; said Védrine, as he carried him along. Working his way with his
      strong elbows through the stream of people who only came up to his
      shoulder, and saying occasionally, &lsquo;Excuse me, gentlemen&mdash;members of
      the family,&rsquo; he brought to the front with him his country friend, who,
      though delighted at the meeting, felt some embarrassment, as the sculptor
      talked after his fashion, freely and audibly. &lsquo;Bless me, what luck
      Loisillon has! Why there weren&rsquo;t more people for Béranger. This is the
      sort of thing to keep a young man&rsquo;s pecker up.&rsquo; Here Freydet, seeing the
      hearse approaching, took off his hat. &lsquo;Good gracious, what have you done
      to your head? Turn round. Why you look like Louis Philippe!&rsquo; The poet&rsquo;s
      moustache was turned down, his hair brushed forward, and his pleasant face
      showed its complexion of ruddy brown between whiskers touched with grey.
      He drew up his short figure with a stiff dignity, whereat Védrine laughing
      said, &lsquo;Ah, I see. Made up for the grandees at Chantilly? So you are still
      bent upon the Académie! Why, just look at the exhibition yonder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sunlight and on the broad enclosure the official attendants
      immediately behind the hearse made a shocking show. Chance might seem to
      have chosen them for a wager among the most ridiculous seniors in the
      Institute, and they looked especially-ugly in the uniform designed by
      David, the coat embroidered with green, the hat, the Court sword, beating
      against legs for which the designer was certainly not responsible. First
      came Gazan; his hat was tilted awry by the bumps of his skull, and the
      vegetable green of the coat threw into relief the earthy colour and scaly
      texture of his elephantine visage. At his side was the grim tall Laniboire
      with purple apoplectic veins and a crooked mouth. His uniform was covered
      by an overcoat whose insufficient length left visible the end of his sword
      and the tails of the frock, and gave him an appearance certainly much less
      dignified than that of the marshal with his black rod, who walked before.
      Those that followed, such as Astier-Réhu and Desminières, were all
      embarrassed and uncomfortable, all acknowledged by their apologetic and
      self-conscious bearing the absurdity of their disguise, which, though it
      might pass in the chastened light of their historic dome, seemed amid the
      real life of the street not less laughable than a show of monkeys. &lsquo;I
      declare one would like to throw some nuts to see if they would go after
      them on all fours,&rsquo; said Freydet&rsquo;s undesirable companion. But Freydet did
      not catch the impertinent remark. He slipped away, mixed with the
      procession, and entered the church between two files of soldiers with arms
      reversed. He was in his heart profoundly glad that Loisillon was dead. He
      had never seen or known him; he could not love him for his work&rsquo;s sake, as
      he had done no work; and the only thing for which he could thank him was
      that he had left his chair empty at such a convenient moment. But he was
      impressed notwithstanding. The funeral pomp to which custom makes the old
      Parisian indifferent, the long line of knapsacks, the muskets that fell on
      the flags with a single blow (at the command of a boyish little martinet,
      with a stock under-his chin, who was probably performing on this occasion
      his first military duty), and, above all, the funeral music and the
      muffled drums, filled him with respectful emotion: and as always happened
      when he felt keenly, rimes began to rise. He had actually got a good
      beginning, presenting a grand picture of the storm and electric agitation
      and mental eclipse produced in the atmosphere of a nation when one of its
      great men disappears. But he broke off his thoughts to make room for
      Danjou, who, having arrived very late, pushed on amid the looks and
      whispers of the ladies, gazing about him coldly and haughtily and passing
      his hand over his head as he habitually does, doubtless to ascertain the
      safety of his back hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He did not recognise me,&rsquo; thought Freydet, hurt by the crushing glance
      with which the Academician relegated to the ranks the nobody who had
      ventured to greet him; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s my whiskers, I suppose.&rsquo; The interruption
      turned the thoughts of the candidate from his verses, and he began to
      consider his plan of operations, his calls, his official announcement to
      the Permanent Secretary. But what was he thinking of? The Permanent
      Secretary was dead! Would Astier-Réhu be appointed before the vacation?
      And when would the election be? He proceeded to consider all the &lsquo;details,
      down to his coat. Should he go to Astier&rsquo;s tailor now? And did the tailor
      supply also the hat and sword?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pie Jesu, Domine</i>, sang a voice behind the altar, the swelling notes
      of an opera singer, asking repose for Loisillon, whom it might be thought
      the Divine Mercy had destined to special torment, for all through the
      church, loud and soft, in every variety of voice, solo and in unison, came
      the supplication for &lsquo;repose, repose.&rsquo; Ah, let him sleep quietly after his
      many years of turmoil and intrigue! The solemn stirring chant was answered
      in the nave by women&rsquo;s sobbing, above which rose the tragic convulsive
      gasp of Marguerite Oger, the gasp so impressive in the fourth act of
      &lsquo;Musidora.&rsquo; All this lamentation touched the kind-hearted candidate and
      linked itself in his feelings to other lamentations and other sorrows. He
      thought of relatives who had died, and of his sister who had been a mother
      to him, and who was now given up by all the doctors, and knew it, and
      spoke of it in every letter. Ah! would she live even to see the day of his
      success? Tears blinded him, and he was obliged to wipe his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t come it too strong, it won&rsquo;t seem genuine,&rsquo; said the sneering voice
      of fat Lavaux, grinning close at his ear. He turned round angrily; but
      here the young officer gave at stentorian pitch the command &lsquo;Carry&mdash;arms!&rsquo; 
      and the bayonets rattled on the muskets while the muffled tones of the
      organ rolled out the &lsquo;Dead March.&rsquo; The procession began to form for
      leaving the church, headed as before by Gazan, Laniboire, Desminières, and
      Freydet&rsquo;s old master, Astier-Réhu. They all looked superb now, the parrot
      green of their laced coats being subdued by the dim religious light of the
      lofty building as they walked down the central aisle, two and two, slowly,
      as if loth to reach the great square of daylight seen through the open
      doors. Behind came the whole Society, headed by its senior member, the
      wonderful old Jean Réhu, looking taller than ever in a long coat, and
      holding up the little brown head, carved, one might fancy, out of a
      cocoa-nut, with an air of contemptuous indifference telling that &lsquo;this was
      a thing he had seen&rsquo; any number of times before. Indeed in the course of
      the sixty years during which he had been in receipt of the tallies of the
      Académie, he must have heard many such funeral chants, and sprinkled much
      holy water on illustrious biers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Jean Réhu was a &lsquo;deity,&rsquo; whose miraculous immortality justified the
      name, it could only be applied in mockery to the band of patriarchs who
      followed him. Decrepit, bent double, gnarled as old apple trees, with feet
      of lead, limp legs, and blinking owlish eyes, they stumbled along, either
      supported on an arm or feeling their way with outstretched hands; and
      their names whispered by the crowd recalled works long dead and forgotten.
      Beside such ghosts as these, &lsquo;on furlough from the cemetery,&rsquo; as was
      remarked by a smart young soldier in the guard of honour, the rest of the
      Academicians seemed young. They posed and strutted before the delighted
      eyes of the ladies, whose bright gleams reached them through the black
      veils, the ranks of the crowd, and the cloaks and knapsacks of the
      bewildered soldiers. On this occasion again Freydet, bowing to two or
      three &lsquo;future colleagues,&rsquo; encountered cold or contemptuous smiles, like
      those which a man sees when he dreams that his dearest friends have
      forgotten him. But he had not time to be depressed, being caught and
      turned about by the double stream which moved up the church and towards
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my lord, you will have to be stirring now,&rsquo; was the advice of
      friendly Picheral, whispered in the midst of the hubbub and the scraping
      of chairs. It sent the candidate&rsquo;s blood tingling through his veins. But
      just as he passed before the bier Danjou muttered, without looking at him,
      as he handed him the holy-water brush, &lsquo;Whatever you do, be quiet, and let
      things slide.&rsquo; His knees shook beneath him. Bestir yourself! Be quiet!
      Which advice was he to take? Which was the best? Doubtless his master,
      Astier, would tell him, and he tried to reach him outside the church. It
      was no easy task in the confusion of the court, where they were forming
      the procession, and lifting the coffin under its heap of countless
      wreaths. Never was a scene more lively than this coming out from the
      funeral into the brilliant daylight; everywhere people were bowing and
      talking gossip quite unconnected with the ceremony, while the bright
      expression on every face showed the reaction after a long hour&rsquo;s sitting
      still and listening to melancholy music. Plans were made, meetings
      arranged; the hurrying stream of life, stopped for a brief while,
      impatiently resumed its course, and poor Loisillon was left far behind in
      the past to which he belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the Français to-night, don&rsquo;t forget; it&rsquo;s the last Tuesday,&rsquo; simpered
      Madame Ancelin, while Paul said to Lavaux, &lsquo;Are you going to see it
      through?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; I&rsquo;m taking Madame Eviza home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then come to Keyser&rsquo;s at six. We shall want freshening after the
      speeches.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mourning coaches were drawing up one after the other, while the
      private carriages set off at a trot. People were leaning out of all the
      windows in the square, and over towards the Boulevard Saint-Germain men
      standing on the stationary tramcars showed tier after tier of heads rising
      in dark relief against the blue sky. Freydet, dazzled by the sun, tilted
      his hat over his eyes and looked at the crowd, which reached as far as he
      could see. He felt proud, transferring to the Académie the posthumous
      glory which certainly could not be ascribed to the author of the &lsquo;Journey
      in Val d&rsquo;Andorre,&rsquo; though at the same time he was distressed at noticing
      that his dear &lsquo;future colleagues&rsquo; obviously kept him at a distance, became
      meditative when he drew near, or turned away, making little groups to keep
      out the intruder. And these were the very men who only two days ago at
      Voisin&rsquo;s had said to him, &lsquo;When are you going to join us?&rsquo; But the
      heaviest blow was the desertion of Astier-Réhu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a calamity, sir!&rsquo; said Freydet, coming up to him and putting on a
      doleful expression for the purpose of saying something sympathetic.
      Astier-Réhu, standing by the hearse, made no answer, but went on turning
      over the leaves of the oration he would shortly have to deliver. &lsquo;What a
      calamity!&rsquo; repeated Freydet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Freydet, you are indecent,&rsquo; said his master, roughly, in a loud
      voice. And with one harsh snap of the jaw he betook himself again to his
      reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indecent! What did he mean? The poor man looked himself over, but could
      find no explanation of the reproach. What was the matter? What had he
      done?
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes he was quite dazed. Vaguely he saw the hearse start under
      its shaking pyramid of flowers, with green coats at the four corners, more
      green coats behind, then all the Society, and immediately following, but
      at a respectful distance, another group, in which he found himself
      involved and carried along he knew not how. Young men, old men, all
      terribly gloomy and depressed, all marked on the brow with the same deep
      furrow, set there by one fixed idea, all expressing with their eyes the
      same hatred and distrust of their neighbours. When he had got over his
      discomfiture, and was able to identify these persons, he recognised the
      faded, hopeless face of old Moser, the candidate everlasting; the honest
      expression of Dalzon, the author of &lsquo;that book,&rsquo; who had failed at the
      last election; and de Salêles!&mdash;and Guérineau!&mdash;Why, they were
      the &lsquo;fish in tow&rsquo;! They were the men about whom the Académie &lsquo;does not
      trouble itself,&rsquo; whom it leaves, hanging on to a strong hook, to be drawn
      along in the wake of the ship of fame. There they all were&mdash;all of
      them, poor drowned fish!&mdash;some dead and under the water; others still
      struggling, turning up sad and greedy eyes full of an eager craving, never
      to be appeased. And while he vowed to himself to avoid a similar fate,
      Abel de Freydet followed the bait and dragged at the line, too firmly
      struck already to get himself free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far away, along the line cleared for the procession, muffled drums
      alternated with the blast of trumpets, bringing crowds of bystanders on
      the pavement and heads to every window. Then the music again took up the
      long-drawn strains of the Hero&rsquo;s March. In the presence of so impressive a
      tribute as this national funeral, this proud protest on the part of
      humanity, crushed and overcome by death but decking defeat in
      magnificence, it was hard to realise that all this pomp was for Loisillon,
      Permanent Secretary of the Académie Française&mdash;for nothing, servant
      to nothing.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      EVERY day between four and six, earlier or later according to the time of
      year, Paul Astier came to take his <i>douche</i> at Keyser&rsquo;s hydropathic
      establishment at the top of the Faubourg Saint-Honoré Twenty minutes&rsquo; 
      fencing, boxing, or single-stick followed by a bath and a cold <i>douche</i>;
      then a little halt at the flower-shop, as he came out, to have a carnation
      stitched in his buttonhole; then a constitutional as far as the Arc de
      l&rsquo;Etoile, Stenne and the phaeton following close to the footway. Finally
      came a turn in the Bois, where Paul, thanks to his observance of
      fashionable hygiene, displayed a feminine delicacy of colouring and a
      complexion rivalling any lady&rsquo;s. By this visit to Keyser&rsquo;s he also saved
      himself the trouble of reading the papers. Gossip went on between one
      dressing-room and another, or on the lounges of the fencing-room, where
      the visitors sat in fencing dress or flannel dressing-gowns, or even
      outside the doctor&rsquo;s door while awaiting the <i>douche</i>. From clubs,
      drawing-rooms, the Chamber, the Bourse, or the Palais de Justice came in
      the news of the day, and there it was proclaimed freely in loud tones, to
      the accompaniment of the clashing of swords and sticks, shouts for the
      waiter, resounding slaps on bare backs, creaking of wheel-chairs for
      rheumatic patients, heavy plunges re-echoing under the reverberating roof
      of the swimming-bath, while above the various sounds of splashing and
      spurting water rose the voice of worthy Dr. Keyser, standing on his
      platform, and the ever-recurring burden, &lsquo;Turn round.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion Paul Astier was &lsquo;turning round&rsquo; under the refreshing
      shower with great enjoyment; he was getting rid of the dust and fatigue of
      his wearisome afternoon, as well as of the lugubrious sonorities of
      Astier-Réhu&rsquo;s Academic regret &lsquo;His hour sounded upon the bell&rsquo;... &lsquo;the
      hand of Loisillon was cold&rsquo;... &lsquo;he had drained the cup of happiness&rsquo;...
      &amp;c, &amp;c. Oh Master! Master! oh, respected papa! It took a good deal
      of water, showers, streams, floods of it, to wash off all that grimy
      rubbish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/182.jpg" width="100%"
       alt="Passed a Tall Figure Bent Double 182 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      As he went away with the water running off him, he passed a tall figure
      bent double, coming up from the swimming bath, which gave him a shivering
      nod from under a huge gutta-percha cap covering the head and half the
      face. The man&rsquo;s lean pallor and stiff stooping walk made Paul take him for
      one of the poor invalids who attend the establishment regularly, and whose
      apparition, silent as night-birds in the fencing-room where they come to
      be weighed, contrasts so strangely with the healthy laughter and
      superabundant vigour of the rest of the company. But the contemptuous
      curve of the large nose and the weary lines round the mouth vaguely
      recalled some face he knew in society. In his dressing-room he asked the
      man who was shampooing him, &lsquo;Who was that, Raymond, who bowed to me just
      now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s the Prince d&rsquo;Athis, sir,&rsquo; replied Raymond, with a plebeian&rsquo;s
      satisfaction in uttering the word &lsquo;prince.&rsquo; &lsquo;He has been taking <i>douches</i>
      for some time past, and generally comes in the morning. But he is later
      to-day, on account of a burial, so he told Joseph.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of Paul&rsquo;s dressing-room was partly open during this dialogue, and
      in the room on the opposite side of the passage was visible La vaux. As he
      pulled on and buckled his long clerical hose, he said, &lsquo;I say, Paul, did
      you see Sammy coming to freshen himself up a bit?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Freshen himself up?&rsquo; said Paul. &lsquo;What for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s going to be married in a fortnight, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! And when does he go to his Embassy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, now, at once. The Princess has started. They are to be married out
      there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul had a horrid presentiment. &lsquo;The Princess?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;Whom is he
      going to marry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where have you been? It&rsquo;s been the talk of Paris for the last two days!
      Colette, of course; Colette the inconsolable. I should like to see what
      the Duchess looks like. At the Loisillon affair she carried herself well,
      but never lifted her veil or spoke a word. It&rsquo;s a tough bit to swallow,
      eh? When you think that only yesterday I was helping her to choose
      materials for the room he was to have at St. Petersburg!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The ill-natured unctuous voice of the fashionable scandalmonger went on
      with the story as he finished buckling his garters, accompanied by the
      sound of a <i>douche</i> two boxes off, and the Prince&rsquo;s voice saying,
      &lsquo;Harder, Joseph, harder, don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rsquo; Freshening himself up, was he?
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul had crossed the passage as soon as Lavaux began to talk, that he
      might hear better. He was seized with a wild desire to kick in the door of
      the Prince&rsquo;s room, spring on him, and have an explanation face to face
      with the scoundrel who was stealing the fortune almost in his grasp.
      Suddenly he perceived that he had nothing on, reflected that his wrath was
      ill-timed, and went back to his room, where he calmed down a little as he
      realised that the first thing to do was to have a talk with his mother and
      find out exactly how matters stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon, for once, he had no flower in his buttonhole, and while,
      as the stream of carriages went past, the ladies looked languidly for the
      charming young man in the usual row, he was driving rapidly to the Rue de
      Beaune. There he was greeted by Corentine with bare arms and a dirty
      apron. She had taken the opportunity of her mistress&rsquo;s absence to have a
      great clean-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know where my mother is dining?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No, her mistress had not told her. But the master was upstairs, rummaging
      in his papers. The little staircase leading to the paper-room creaked
      under Léonard Astier&rsquo;s heavy tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that you, Paul?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dim light of the passage and his own agitation prevented the young man
      from noticing his father&rsquo;s extraordinary appearance and the dazed sound of
      his voice when he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How&rsquo;s the Master?&rsquo; said the son&mdash;&lsquo;So mamma&rsquo;s not in?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, she is dining with Madame Ancelin and going on to the Français; I am
      to join them in the evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the father and son had nothing further to say to each other.
      They met like two strangers, like two men of hostile races. On this
      occasion, indeed, Paul in his impatience was half inclined to ask Leonard
      whether he knew anything about the marriage; but he thought the next
      minute, &lsquo;No, he is too stupid; mother would never say a word to him.&rsquo; His
      father, who was also strongly tempted to put a question, called him back
      with an air of embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Paul,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I have lost&mdash;I can&rsquo;t find&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t find what?&rsquo; asked the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astier-Réhu hesitated a moment; but after looking closely at the pretty
      face, whose expression, on account of the bend in the nose, was never
      perfectly straightforward, he added in a gloomy, surly tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, nothing; it does not matter. I won&rsquo;t keep you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing for it but to meet his mother at the theatre in Madame
      Ancelin&rsquo;s box. That meant two or three hours to be got through first. Paul
      dismissed his carriage and ordered Stenne to bring him his dress things at
      his club. Then he started for a stroll through the city in a faint
      twilight, while the clipped shrubs of the Tuileries Gardens assumed
      brighter colours as the sky grew dark around them. It was the mystic hour
      so precious to people pursuing dreams or making plans. The carriages grow
      fewer, the shadowy figures hurry by and touch the stroller lightly. There
      is no interruption to the flow of a man&rsquo;s thoughts. So the ambitious young
      fellow, who had quite recovered his presence of mind, carried on his
      reflections clearly. His thoughts were like those of Napoleon at the last
      hour of the battle of Waterloo: after a long day of success defeat had
      come with night. What was the reason? What mistake had he made? He
      replaced the pieces on the chessboard, and looked for the explanation of
      failure, but in vain. It had perhaps been rash of him to let two days pass
      without seeing her. But it was the most elementary rule that after such a
      scene as that in the cemetery a woman should be left to herself to
      recover. How was he to foresee this sudden flight? Suddenly a hope flashed
      upon him. He knew that the Princess changed her plan as often as a bird
      its perch. Perhaps she might not yet have gone; perhaps he should find her
      in the midst of preparations, unhappy, undecided, asking Herbert&rsquo;s
      portrait for advice, and should win her back by one embrace. He understood
      and could follow now all the capricious turns of the romance which had
      been going on in her little head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a cab to the Rue de Courcelles. Nobody there. The Princess had
      gone abroad, they told him, that very morning. A terrible fit of despair
      came over him, and he went home instead of to the club, so as not to have
      to talk and answer questions. His spirits sank even lower at the sight of
      his great mediaeval erection and its front, in the style of the <i>Tour de
      la Faim</i>, all covered with bills; it suggested the piles of overdue
      accounts. As he felt his way in, he was greeted by a smell of fried onions
      filling the whole place; for his spruce little valet on nights when his
      master dined at the club would cook himself a tasty dish. A gleam of
      daylight still lingered in the studio, and Paul flung himself down on a
      sofa. There, as he was trying to think by what ill-luck his artfullest,
      cleverest designs had been upset, he fell asleep for a couple of hours and
      woke up another man. Just as memory gains in sharpness during the sleep of
      the body, so had his determination and talent for intrigue gone on acting
      during his short rest. He had found a new plan, and moreover a calm fixity
      of resolution, such as among the modern youth of France is very much more
      rarely met with than courage under arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dressed rapidly and took a couple of eggs and a cup of tea; and when,
      with a faint odour of the warm curling-iron about his beard and
      moustaches, he entered the Théâtre Français and gave Madame Ancelin&rsquo;s name
      at the box-office, the keenest observer would have failed to detect any
      absorbing preoccupation in the perfect gentleman of fashion, and would
      never have guessed the contents of this pretty drawing-room article,
      black-and-white lacquered, and well locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Ancelin&rsquo;s worship of official literature had two temples, the
      Académie Française and the Comédie Française. But the first of these
      places being open to the pious believer only at uncertain periods, she
      made the most of the second, and attended its services with great
      regularity. She never missed a &lsquo;first night,&rsquo; whether important or
      unimportant, nor any of the Subscribers&rsquo; Tuesdays. And as she read no
      books but those stamped with the hall-mark of the Académie, so the actors
      at the Comédie were the only players to whom she listened with enthusiasm,
      with excited ejaculations and rapturous amazement. Her exclamations began
      at the box-office, at the sight of the two great marble fonts, which the
      good lady&rsquo;s fancy had set up before the statues of Rachel and Talma in the
      entrance to the &lsquo;House of Molière.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t they look after it well? Just look at the door-keepers! What a
      theatre it is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The jerky movements of her short arms and the puffing of her fat little
      body diffused through the passage a sense of noisy gleefulness which made
      people say in every box, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s Madame Ancelin!&rsquo; On Tuesdays especially,
      the fashionable indifference of the house contrasted oddly with the seat
      where, in supreme content, leaning half out of the box, sat and cooed this
      good plump pink-eyed pigeon, piping away audibly, &lsquo;Look at Coquelin! Look
      at De-launay! What perennial youth! What an admirable theatre!&rsquo; She never
      allowed her friends to talk of anything else, and in the <i>entr&rsquo;actes</i>
      greeted her visitors with exclamations of rapture over the genius of the
      Academic playwright and the grace of the Actress-Associate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Paul Astier&rsquo;s entrance the curtain was up; and knowing that the ritual
      of Madame Ancelin required absolute silence at such a time, he waited
      quietly in the little room, separated by a step from the front of the box,
      where Madame Ancelin was seated in bliss between Madame Astier and Madame
      Eviza, while behind were Danjou and De Freydet looking like prisoners. The
      click, which the box-door made and must make in shutting, was followed by
      a &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; calculated to appal the intruder who was disturbing the service.
      Madame Astier half turned round, and felt a shiver at the sight of her
      son. What was the matter? What had Paul to say to her of such pressing
      importance as to bring him to that haunt of boredom&mdash;Paul, who never
      let himself be bored without a reason? Money again, no doubt, horrid
      money! Well, fortunately she would soon have plenty; Sammy&rsquo;s marriage
      would make them all rich. Much as she longed to go up to Paul and reassure
      him with the good news, which perhaps he had not heard, she was obliged to
      stay in her seat, look on at the play, and join as chorus in her hostess&rsquo;s
      exclamations, &lsquo;Look at Coquelin! Look at De-launay! Oh! Oh!&rsquo; It was a hard
      trial to her to have to wait So it was to Paul, who could see nothing but
      the glaring heat of the footlights, and in the looking-glass at the side
      the reflection of part of the house, stalls, dress-circle, boxes, rows of
      faces, pretty dresses, bonnets, all as it were drowned in a blue haze, and
      presenting the colourless ghostly appearance of things dimly seen under
      water. During the <i>entr&rsquo;acte</i> came the usual infliction of
      indiscriminate praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur Paul! Di&rsquo; y&rsquo; see Reichemberg&rsquo;s dress? Di&rsquo; y&rsquo; see the pink-bead
      apron? and the ribbon ruching? Di&rsquo; y&rsquo; see? This is the only place where
      they know how to dress, that it is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Visitors began to come, and the mother was able to get hold of her son and
      carry him off to the sofa. There, in the midst of wraps and the bustle of
      people going out, they spoke in low voices with their heads close
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Answer me quickly and clearly,&rsquo; began Paul &lsquo;Is Sammy going to be
      married?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, the Duchess heard yesterday. But she has come here to-night all the
      same. Corsican pride!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And whom has he caught? Can you tell me now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Colette, of course! You must have had a suspicion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not the least,&rsquo; said Paul. &lsquo;And what shall you get for it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She murmured triumphantly, &lsquo;Eight thousand pounds!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, by your schemes I have lost a million!&mdash;a million, and a
      wife!&rsquo; He grasped her by the wrists in his anger, and hissed into her
      face, &lsquo;You selfish marplot!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The news took away her breath and her senses. It was Paul then, Paul, from
      whom proceeded the force which acted, as she had occasionally perceived,
      against her influence; it was Paul whom the little fool was thinking of
      when she said, sobbing in her arms, &lsquo;If you only knew!&rsquo; And now, just at
      the end of the mines which with so much cunning and skilful patience they
      had each been driving towards the treasure, one last stroke of the axe had
      brought them face to face, empty-handed! They sat silent, looking at each
      other, with corresponding crooks in their noses and the same fierce gleam
      in both pairs of grey eyes, while all around them were the stir of people
      coming and going and the buzz of conversation. Rigid indeed is the
      discipline of society, seeing that it could repress in these two creatures
      all the cries and groans, all the desire to roar and slay, which filled
      and shook their hearts. Madame Astier was the first to express her
      thoughts aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If only the Princess were not gone!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And she writhed her lips with rage at the thought that the sudden
      departure had been her own suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will get her back,&rsquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Without answering her question, he asked, &lsquo;Is Sammy here to-night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think so, as <i>she</i> is&mdash;&mdash; Where are you going?
      what do you mean to do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep quiet, won&rsquo;t you? Don&rsquo;t interfere. You are too unlucky for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He left with a crowd of visitors who were driven away by the end of the <i>entr&rsquo;acte</i>,
      and she went back to her seat on Madame Ancelin&rsquo;s left. Her hostess
      worshipped with the same ecstasy as before, and it was one perpetual
      giving of thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, look at Coquelin! What humour he has! My dear, do look at him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear&rsquo; was indeed not attending; her eyes wandered, and on her lips was
      the painful smile of a dancer hissed off the boards. With the excuse that
      the footlights dazzled her, she was turning every moment towards the
      audience to look for her son. Perhaps there would be a duel with the
      Prince, if he was there. And all her fault&mdash;all through her stupid
      bungling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s Delaunay! Di&rsquo; y&rsquo; see him? Di&rsquo; y&rsquo; see?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she had seen nothing but the Duchess&rsquo;s box, where some one had just
      come in, with a youthful elegant figure, like her Paul. But it was the
      little Count Adriani, who had heard of the rupture like the rest of Paris
      and was already tracking the game. Through the rest of the play the mother
      ate her heart out in misery, turning over innumerable confused plans for
      the future, mixed in her thoughts with past events and scenes which ought
      to have forewarned her. Stupid, how stupid of her! How had she failed to
      guess?
    </p>
    <p>
      At last came the departure, but oh how long it took! She had to stop every
      moment, to bow or smile to her friends, to say good-bye. &lsquo;What are you
      going to do this summer? Do come and see us at Deauville.&rsquo; All down the
      narrow passage crammed with people, where ladies finish putting on their
      wraps with a pretty movement to make sure of their ear-rings, all down the
      white marble staircase to the men-servants waiting at the foot, the
      mother, as she talks, still watches, listens, tries to catch in the hum of
      the great fashionable swarm dispersing for some months a word or hint of a
      scene that evening in a box. Here comes the Duchess, haughty and erect in
      her long white and gold mantle, taking the arm of the young officer of the
      Papal Guard. She knows the shabby trick her friend has played her, and as
      the two women pass they exchange a cold expressionless glance more to be
      dreaded than the most violent expletive of a fishwoman. They know now what
      to think of each other; they know that in the poisoned warfare, which is
      to succeed their sisterly intimacy, every blow will tell, will be directed
      to the right spot by practised hands. But they discharge the task imposed
      by society, and both wear the same mask of indifference, so that the
      masterful hate of the one can meet and strike against the spiteful hate of
      the other without producing a spark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Downstairs, in the press of valets and young clubmen, Léonard Astier was
      waiting, as he had promised, for his wife. &lsquo;Ah, there is the great man!&rsquo; 
      exclaimed Madame Ancelin; and with a final dip of her fingers into the
      holy water she scattered it around her broadcast, over the great
      Astier-Réhu, the great Danjou, and Coquelin, you know! and Delaunay, you
      know! Oh! Oh! Oh!&mdash;Astier did not reply, but followed with his wife
      on his arm and his collar turned up against the draught. It was raining.
      Madame Ancelin offered to take them home; but it was only with the
      conventional politeness of a &lsquo;carriage&rsquo; lady afraid of tiring her horses
      and still more afraid of her coachman&rsquo;s temper (she has invariably the
      best coachman in Paris). Besides, &lsquo;the great man&rsquo; had a cab; and without
      waiting for the lady&rsquo;s benediction&mdash;&lsquo;Ah, well, we know you two like
      to be alone. Ah! what a happy household!&rsquo;&mdash;he dragged off Madame
      Astier along the wet and dirty colonnade.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at the end of a ball or evening party, a fashionable couple drive
      off in their carriage, the question always suggests itself, &lsquo;Now what will
      they say?&rsquo; Not much usually, for the man generally comes away from this
      kind of festivity weary and knocked up, while the lady continues the party
      in the darkness of the carriage by inward comparisons of her dress and her
      looks with those she has just seen, and makes plans for the arrangement of
      her drawing-room or a new costume. Still the restraint of feature required
      by society is so excessive, and fashionable hypocrisy has reached such a
      height, that it would be interesting to be present at the moment when the
      conventional attitude is relaxed, to hear the real natural tone of voice,
      and to realise the actual relations of the beings thus suddenly released
      from trammels and sent rolling home in the light of their brougham lamps
      through the empty streets of Paris. In the case of the Astiers the return
      home was very characteristic. The moment they were alone the wife laid
      aside the deference and pretended interest exhibited towards the Master in
      society, and spoke her mind, compensating herself in so doing for the
      attention with which she had listened for the hundredth time to old
      stories which bored her to death. The husband, kindly by disposition and
      accustomed to think well of himself and everyone else, invariably came
      home in a state of bliss, and was horrified at the malicious comments of
      his wife on their hosts and the guests they had met. Madame Astier would
      utter calmly the most shocking accusations, exaggerating gossip in the
      light unconscious way which is characteristic of Parisian society. Rather
      than stimulate her he would hold his tongue and turn round in his corner
      to take a little doze. But on this evening Léonard sat down straight,
      regardless of the sharp &lsquo;Do mind my dress!&rsquo; which showed that somebody&rsquo;s
      skirts were being crumpled. What did he care about her dress? &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been
      robbed!&rsquo; he said, in such a tone that the windows rattled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh dear, the autographs! She had not been thinking of them, least of all
      just now, when tormented by very different anxieties, and there was
      nothing feigned in her surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robbed&mdash;yes, robbed of his &lsquo;Charles-the-Fifths,&rsquo; the three best
      things in his collection! But the assurance which made his attack so
      violent died out of his voice, and his suspicion hesitated, at the sight
      of Adelaide&rsquo;s surprise. Meanwhile she recovered her self-possession. &lsquo;But
      whom do you suspect?&rsquo; Corentine, she thought, was trustworthy. Teyssèdre?
      It was hardly likely that an ignorant&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Teyssèdre! He exclaimed at it, the thing seemed so obvious. Helped by his
      hatred for the man of polish, he soon began to see how the crime had come
      about, and traced it step by step from a chance allusion at dinner to the
      value of his documents, heard by Corentine and repeated in all innocence.
      Ah, the scoundrel! Why, he had the skull of a criminal! Foolish to
      struggle against the intimations of instinct! There must be something out
      of the common, when a floor-polisher could arouse so strange an antipathy
      in a member of the Institute! Ah, well, the dolt was done for now! He
      should catch it! &lsquo;My three Charleses! Only fancy!&rsquo; He wanted to inform the
      police at once, before going home. His wife tried to prevent him. &lsquo;Are you
      out of your mind? Go to the police-station after midnight?&rsquo; But he
      insisted, and thrust his great numskull out into the rain to give orders
      to the driver. She was obliged to pull him back with an effort, and
      feeling too much exhausted to carry on the lie, to let him say his say and
      bring him round gradually, she came out with the whole truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not Teyssèdre&mdash;it&rsquo;s I! There!&rsquo; At one breath she poured out the
      story of her visit to Bos, the money she had got, the 800L., and the
      necessity for it. The silence which ensued was so long that at first she
      thought he had had a fit of apoplexy. It was not that; but like a child
      that falls or hits itself, poor Crocodilus had opened his mouth so wide to
      let out his anger, and taken so deep a breath, that he could not utter a
      sound. At last came a roar that filled the Carrousel, where their cab was
      at that minute splashing through the pools.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Robbed, robbed! Robbed by my wife for the sake of her son!&rsquo; In his insane
      fury he jumbled together indiscriminately the abusive patois of his native
      hillside, &lsquo;<i>Ah la garso! Ah li bongri!</i>&rsquo; with the classical
      exclamations of Harpagon bewailing his casket, <i>Justice, justice du
      ciel!</i>&rsquo; and other select extracts often recited to his pupils. It was
      as light as day in the bright rays of the tall electric lamps standing
      round the great square, over which, as the theatres were emptying,
      omnibuses and carriages were now passing in all directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do be quiet,&rsquo; said Madame Astier; &lsquo;everyone knows you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Except you, Madame!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought he was going to beat her, and in the strained condition of her
      nerves it might perhaps have been a relief. But under the terror of a
      scandal he suddenly quieted down, swearing finally by his mother&rsquo;s ashes
      that as soon as he got home he would pack up his trunk and go straight off
      to Sauvagnat, leaving his wife to depart with her scoundrelly prodigal and
      live on their spoils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more the deep old box with its big nails was brought hastily from the
      anteroom into the study. A few billets of wood were still left in it from
      the winter&rsquo;s supply, but the &lsquo;deity&rsquo; did not change his purpose for that.
      For an hour the house resounded with the rolling of logs and the banging
      of cupboard doors, as he flung among the sawdust and bits of dry bark
      linen, clothes, boots, and even the green coat and embroidered waistcoat
      of the Academic full dress, carefully put away in napkins. His wrath was
      relieved by this operation, and diminished as he filled his trunk, till
      his last resentful grumblings died away when it occurred to him that,
      fixed as he was to his place, to uproot himself was utterly impossible.
      Meanwhile Madame Astier, sitting on the edge of an armchair in her
      dressing-gown, with a lace wrap round her head, watched his proceedings
      and murmured between yawn and yawn with placid irony, &lsquo;Really, Léonard,
      really!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My notion is that people, like things, have a right and a wrong way up,
      and there&rsquo;s always a place to get hold of, if you want to have a good
      control and grasp of them. I know where the place is, and that&rsquo;s my power!
      Driver, to the Tête Noire.&rsquo; At Paul Astier&rsquo;s order the open carriage, in
      which the three tall hats belonging to Freydet, Védrine, and himself rose
      in funereal outline against the brightness of the afternoon landscape,
      drew up on the right-hand side of the bridge at St. Cloud, in front of the
      inn he had named. Every jolt of the hired conveyance over the paving of
      the square brought into sight an ominous long case of green baize
      projecting beyond the lowered hood of the carriage. Paul had chosen, as
      seconds for this meeting with D&rsquo;Athis, first the Vicomte de Freydet, on
      account of his title and his &lsquo;de,&rsquo; and with him the Count Adriani. But the
      Papal Embassy was afraid of adding another scandal to the recent affair of
      the Cardinal&rsquo;s hat, and he had been obliged to find a substitute for
      Pepino in the sculptor, who would perhaps allow himself at the last minute
      to be described in the official statement as &lsquo;Marquis.&rsquo; The matter,
      however, was not supposed to be serious, only a quarrel at the club over
      the card-table, where the Prince had taken a hand for a last game before
      leaving Paris. The affair could not be hushed up; it was specially
      impossible to cave in to a fighting man like Paul Astier, who had a great
      reputation in fencing rooms, and whose records were framed and hung in the
      shooting-gallery in the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the carriage waited by the terrace of the <i>restaurant</i> and the
      waiters unobtrusively bestowed on it knowing glances, down a steep little
      path came rolling a short, fat man, with the white spats, white tie, silk
      hat, and captivating air of the doctor of a fashionable watering-place. He
      made signals from the distance with his sunshade, there&rsquo;s Gomes,&rsquo; said
      Paul. Doctor Gomes, formerly on the resident staff of one of the Paris
      hospitals, had been ruined by play and an old attachment. Now he was
      &lsquo;Uncle Gomes,&rsquo; and had an irregular practice; not a bad fellow, but one
      who would stick at nothing, and had made a specialty of affairs like the
      present. Fee, two guineas and breakfast. Just now he was spending his
      holiday with Cloclo at Ville d&rsquo;Avray, and came puffing to the meeting
      place, carrying a little bag which held his instrument case, medicines,
      bandages, splints&mdash;enough to set up an ambulance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it to be scratch or wound?&rsquo; he asked, as he took his seat in the
      carriage opposite Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Scratch, of course, doctor, scratch, with swords of the Institute. The
      Académie Française against the Sciences Morales et Politiques.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gomès smiled as he steadied his bag between his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not know, so I brought the big apparatus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you must display it; it will impress the enemy,&rsquo; suggested Védrine,
      in his quiet way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor winked, a little put out by the two seconds, whose faces were
      unknown to the boulevards, and to whom Paul Astier, who treated him like a
      servant, did not even introduce him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the carriage started, the window of a room on the first floor opened,
      and a pair came and looked at them curiously. The girl was Marie Donval,
      of the Gymnase, whom the doctor recognised and named in a loud voice. The
      other was a deformed little creature, whose head was barely visible above
      the window-sill. Freydet, with much indignation, and Védrine, with some
      amusement, recognised Fage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you surprised, M. de Freydet?&rsquo; said Paul. And hereupon he launched
      into a savage attack upon woman. Woman! A disordered child, with all a
      child&rsquo;s perversity and wickedness, all its instinctive desire to cheat, to
      lie, to tease, all its cowardice. She was greedy, she was vain, she was
      inquisitive. Oh yes, she could serve you a hash of somebody else, but she
      had not an idea of her own; and in argument, why, she was as full of
      holes, twists, and slippery places as the pavement on a frosty night after
      a thaw. How was conversation possible with a woman? Why, there was nothing
      in her, neither kindness nor pity nor intellect&mdash;not leven common
      sense. For a fashionable bonnet or one of Spricht&rsquo;s gowns she was capable
      of stealing, of any trick however dirty; for at bottom the only thing she
      cares for is dress. To know the strength of this passion a man must have
      gone, as Paul had, with the most elegant ladies of fashion to the rooms of
      the great man-milliner. They were hand-and-glove with the forewomen, asked
      them to breakfast at their country houses, knelt to old Spricht as if he
      were the Pope himself. The Marquise de Roca-Nera took her young daughters
      to him, and all but asked him to bless them!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; said the doctor, with the automatic jerk of a hireling whose
      neck has been put out of joint by perpetual acquiescence. Then followed an
      awkward pause, the conversation being, as it were, thrown out of gear by
      this sudden and unexpectedly violent effusion from a young fellow usually
      very civil and self-possessed. The sun was oppressive, and was reflected
      off the dry stone walls on each side of the steep road, up which the
      horses were toiling painfully, while the pebbles creaked under the wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To show the kindness and pity of woman, I can vouch for the following.&rsquo; 
      It was Védrine who spoke, his head thrown back and swaying as it rested on
      the hood of the carriage, his eyes half shut as he looked at some inward
      vision. &lsquo;It was not at the great milliner&rsquo;s. It was at the Hôtel-Dieu, in
      Bouchereau&rsquo;s department. A rough, white-washed cell, an iron bedstead with
      all the clothes thrown off, and on it, stark naked, covered with sweat and
      foam, contorted and twisted like a clown with sudden springs and with
      yells that re-echoed through the fore-court of Notre Dame, a madman in the
      last agony. Beside the bed two women, one on either side, the Sister, and
      one of Bouchereau&rsquo;s little lady-students, both quite young, yet with no
      disgust and no fear, both leaning over the poonwretch whom no one dared go
      near, wiping from his brow and mouth the sweat of his agony and the
      suffocating foam. The Sister was praying all the time; the other was not.
      But in the inspired look in the eyes of both, in the gentleness of the
      brave little hands which wiped away the madman&rsquo;s foam right from under his
      teeth, in the heroic and maternal beauty of their unwearied movements, you
      felt that they were both very women. There is woman! It was enough to make
      a man fall on his knees and sob.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, Védrine,&rsquo; said Freydet under his breath; he had been choking
      with the recollection of the dear one at Clos Jallanges. The doctor began
      his jerk and his &lsquo;just so,&rsquo; but was cut short by the dry, incisive tones
      of Paul Astier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, sick nurses, I&rsquo;ll allow. Sickly themselves, nothing gives them
      such pleasure as nursing, dressing, bathing their patients, handling hot
      towels and basins; and then there&rsquo;s the power they exercise over the
      suffering and the weak.&rsquo; His voice hissed and rose to the pitch of his
      mother&rsquo;s, while from his cold eye darted a little gleam of wickedness
      which made his companions wonder &lsquo;what is up,&rsquo; and suggested to the doctor
      the sage reflection, &lsquo;All very well to talk about a scratch, and swords of
      the Institute, but I should not care to be in the Prince&rsquo;s skin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;ll paint you a pendant to our friend&rsquo;s chromo,&rsquo; sneered Paul. &lsquo;As a
      specimen of feminine delicacy and faithfulness, take a little widow, who
      even in the burial vault of the departed, and on his very tombstone&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>The Ephesian Matron!</i>&rsquo; broke in Védrine, &lsquo;you want to tell us
      that!&rsquo; The discussion grew animated and ran on, still to an accompaniment
      of the jolting wheels, upon the never-failing topics of masculine
      discussion, woman and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen, look,&rsquo; said the doctor, who from his place on the front seat
      saw two carriages coming up the hill at a quick trot. In the first, an
      open victoria, were the Prince&rsquo;s seconds. Gomes stood up, and as he sat
      down again named them in a low and respectful tone, &lsquo;the Marquis d&rsquo;Urbin
      and General de Bonneuil of the Jockey Club&mdash;very good form&mdash;and
      my brother-surgeon, Aubouis.&rsquo; This Doctor Aubouis was another low-caste of
      the same stamp as Gomes; but as he had a ribbon his fee was five guineas.
      Behind was a little brougham in which, along with the inseparable Lavaux,
      was concealed D&rsquo;Athis, desperately bored with the whole business. During
      five minutes the three vehicles went up the hill one behind another like a
      wedding or funeral procession, and nothing was heard but the sound of the
      wheels and the panting or snorting of the horses as they rattled their
      bits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pass them,&rsquo; said a haughty nasal voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By all means,&rsquo; said Paul, &lsquo;they are going to see to our quarters.&rsquo; The
      wheels grazed on the narrow road, the seconds bowed, the doctors exchanged
      professional smiles. Then the brougham went by, showing behind the window
      glass, pulled up in spite of the heat, a morose motionless profile, as
      pale as a corpse. &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t be paler than that an hour hence, when they
      take him home with a hole in his side,&rsquo; thought Paul, and he pictured the
      exact thrust, feint No. 2, followed by a direct lunge straight in between
      the third and fourth ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of the hill the air was cooler, and laden with the scent of
      lime-flowers, acacias, and roses warm in the sun. Behind the low park
      railings sloped great lawns over which moved the mottled shadows of the
      trees. Presently was heard the bell of a garden gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here we are,&rsquo; said the doctor, who knew the place. It was where the
      Marquis d&rsquo;Urbin&rsquo;s stud used to be, but for the last two years it had been
      for sale. All the horses were gone, except a few colts gambolling about in
      fields separated by high barriers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duel was to take place at the further end of the estate, on a wide
      terrace in front of a white brick stable. It was reached by sloping paths
      all overgrown with moss and grass, along which both parties walked
      together, mingling, but not speaking, proper as could be; except that
      Védrine, unable to support these fashionable formalities, scandalised
      Freydet, who carried his high collar with much gravity, by exclaiming,
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a lily of the valley,&rsquo; or pulling off a bough, and presently,
      struck with the contrast between the splendid passivity of nature and the
      futile activity of man, ejaculated, as he gazed on the great woods that
      climbed the opposite hill-side, and the distance composed of clustered
      roofs, shining water and blue haze, &lsquo;How beautiful, how peaceful!&rsquo; With an
      involuntary movement he pointed to the horizon, for the benefit of some
      one whose patent leather boots came squeaking behind him. But oh, what an
      outpouring of contempt, not only upon the improper Védrine, but upon the
      landscape and the sky! The Prince d&rsquo;Athis was unsurpassed in contempt. He
      expressed it with his eye, the celebrated eye whose flash had always
      overcome Bismarck; he expressed it with his great hooked nose, and with
      the turned down corners of his mouth; he expressed it without reason,
      without inquiry, study, or thought, and his rise in diplomacy, his
      successes in love and in society, were all the work of this supposed
      contempt!
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality &lsquo;Sammy &lsquo;was an empty-headed bauble, a puppet picked by a clever
      woman&rsquo;s compassion out of the refuse and oyster shells of the
      supper-tavern, raised by her higher and higher, prompted by her what to
      say and, more important still, what not to say, lessoned and guided by
      her, till the day when, finding himself at the top of the ladder, he
      kicked away the stool which he no longer wanted. Society thought him a
      very clever fellow, but Védrine did not share the general opinion; and the
      comparison of Talleyrand to a &lsquo;silk stocking full of mud&rsquo; came into his
      mind as he watched this highly respectable and proper personage stalk
      majestically past him. Evidently the Duchess had her wits about her when
      she disguised his emptiness by making him both diplomatist and
      academician, and cloaking him for the official carnival with the double
      thickness of both the two thread-bare, though venerable, dominos, to which
      society continues to bow. But how she could have loved such a hollow,
      stony-hearted piece of crockery, Védrine did not understand. Was it his
      title? But her family was as good as his. Was it the English cut of his
      clothes, the frock coat closely fitted to his broken-down shoulders, and
      the mud-coloured trousers that made so crude a bit of colour among the
      trees? One might almost think that the young villain, Paul, was right in
      his contemptuous remarks on woman&rsquo;s taste for what is low, for deformity
      in morals or physique!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince had reached the three-foot fence which divided the path from
      the meadow, and either because he mistrusted his slender legs, or because
      he thought a vigorous movement improper for a man of his position, he
      hesitated, particularly bothered by the sense that &lsquo;that huge artist
      fellow&rsquo; was just at his back. At last he made up his mind to step out of
      his way to a gap in the wooden fence. Védrine winked his little eyes. &lsquo;Go
      round, my good sir,&rsquo; was his thought, &lsquo;go round; make the road as long as
      you will, it must bring you in the end to the front of the white building
      yonder. And when you get there, you may possibly have to pay a heavy
      reckoning for all your scoundrelly tricks. There is always a reckoning to
      pay in the end.&rsquo; Having relieved his mind by this soliloquy, he jumped
      clean over the fence without so much as putting a hand on it (a proceeding
      extremely improper), and joined the knot of seconds busily engaged in
      casting lots for places and swords. In spite of the dandified solemnity of
      their aspect, they looked, as they all bent to see whether the toss fell
      head or tail, or ran to pick up the coins, like big school-boys in the
      playground, wrinkled and grey. During a discussion on a doubtful pitch,
      Védrine heard his name called by Astier, who, with perfect
      self-possession, was taking off his coat and emptying his pockets behind
      the little building. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that stuff the General is talking? Wants to
      have his walking-stick within reach of our swords, to prevent accidents? I
      won&rsquo;t have that sort of thing, do you hear? This is not a lower school
      fight. We are both old hands, fifth form.&rsquo; In spite of his light words,
      his teeth were clenched and his eye gleamed fiercely. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s serious then?&rsquo; 
      asked Védrine, looking at him hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be more so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Somehow I thought as much,&rsquo; and the sculptor returned to convey the
      message to the General, commander of a cavalry division, looking all leg
      from his heels to his pointed ears, which in brilliancy of colour vied
      with Freydet&rsquo;s. At Védrine&rsquo;s intimation these ears flushed suddenly
      scarlet, as if the blood boiled in them. &lsquo;Right, Sir! &lsquo;Course, Sir!&rsquo; His
      words cut the air like the lash of a whip. Sammy was being helped by
      Doctor Aubouis to turn up his shirt sleeves. Did he hear? or was it the
      aspect of the lithe, cat-like, vigorous young fellow as he came forward
      with neck and arms bare and round as a woman&rsquo;s, and with that pitiless
      look. Be the reason what it may, D&rsquo;Athis, who had come to the ground as a
      social duty without a shade of anxiety, as befitted a gentleman who was
      not inexperienced and knew the value of two good seconds, suddenly changed
      countenance, turned earthy pale, while his beard scarcely concealed the
      twitch of his jaw in the horrible contortion of fear. But he kept his
      self-control, and put himself on the defensive bravely enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, gentlemen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there is always a reckoning to pay. He realised that keenly as he
      faced that pitiless sword-point, which sought him, felt him at a distance,
      seemed to spare him now only to make more sure of hitting presently. They
      meant to kill him; that was certain. And as he parried the blows with his
      long, thin arm stretched out, amid the clashing of the hilts he felt, for
      the first time, a pang of remorse for his mean desertion of the noble lady
      who had lifted him out of the gutter and given him once more a decent
      place in the world; he felt too that her merited wrath was in some way
      connected with this present encompassing peril, which seemed to shake the
      air all about him, to send round and round in a glancing, vanishing vision
      the expanse of sky overhead, the alarmed faces of the seconds and doctors,
      and the remoter figures of two stable boys wildly beating off with their
      caps the gambolling horses that wanted to come and look on. Suddenly came
      exclamations, sharp and peremptory: &lsquo;Enough! Stop, stop!&rsquo; What has
      happened? The peril is gone, the sky stands still, everything has resumed
      its natural colour and place. But at his feet over the torn and trampled
      ground spreads a widening pool of blood, which darkens the yellow soil,
      and in it lies Paul Astier helpless, with a wound right through his bare
      neck, stuck like a pig. In the still pause of horror which followed the
      disaster was heard the shrill, unceasing noise of insects in the distant
      meadow, while the horses, no longer watched, gathered together a little
      way off and stretched out inquisitive noses towards the motionless body of
      the vanquished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he was a skilful swordsman. His fingers had a firm grasp of the hilt
      and could make the whistling blade flash, hover, and descend where he
      pleased, while his adversary encountered him with a wavering cowardly
      spit. How had it come about? The seconds will say, and the evening papers
      repeat, and to-morrow all Paris will take up the cue, that Paul Astier
      slipped as he made his thrust and ran on his opponent&rsquo;s point. A full and
      accurate account will no doubt be given: but in life it usually happens
      that decision of language varies inversely with certainty of knowledge.
      Even from the spectators, even from the combatants themselves, a certain
      mist and confusion will always veil the crucial moment, when, against all
      reasonable calculation, the final stroke was given by intervening fate,
      wrapped in that obscure cloud which by epic rule closes round the end of a
      contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carried into a small coachman&rsquo;s room adjoining the stable, Paul, on
      opening his eyes after a long swoon, saw first from the iron bedstead on
      which he lay a lithographic print of the Prince Imperial pinned to the
      wall over the drawers, which were covered with surgical instruments. As
      consciousness returned to him through the medium of external objects, the
      poor melancholy face with its faded eyes, discoloured by the damp of the
      walls, suggested a sad omen of ill-fated youth. But besides ambition and
      cunning, Paul had his full share of courage; and raising with difficulty
      his head and its cumbrous wrapping of bandages, he asked in a voice broken
      and weak, though fleeting still, &lsquo;Wound or scratch, doctor?&rsquo; Gomes, who
      was rolling up his medicated wool, waved to him to keep quiet, as he
      answered, &lsquo;Scratch, you lucky dog; but a near shave. Aubouis and I thought
      the carotid was cut.&rsquo; A faint colour came into the young man&rsquo;s cheeks, and
      his eyes sparkled. It is so satisfactory not to die! Instantly his
      ambition revived, and he wanted to know how long he should take to get
      well again. &lsquo;From three weeks to a month.&rsquo; Such was the doctor&rsquo;s judgment,
      announced in an indifferent tone with an amusing shade of contempt. He was
      really very much annoyed and mortified that his patient had got the worst
      of it. Paul with his eyes on the wall was making calculations. D&rsquo;Athis
      would be gone and Colette married before he was even out of bed. Well,
      that business had failed; he must look out for something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened, and a great flood of light poured into the miserable
      room. How delightful was life and the warm sunshine! Védrine, coming in
      with Freydet, went up to the bed and held out his hand joyously, saying
      &lsquo;You did give us a fright!&rsquo; He was really fond of his young rascal, and
      cherished him as a work of art. &lsquo;Ah, that you did!&rsquo; said Freydet, wiping
      his brow with an air of great relief. His eyes had seen all his hopes of
      election to the Académie lying on the ground in that pool of blood. How
      could Astier, the father, ever have come out as the champion of a man
      connected with such a fatal event? Not but that Freydet had a warm heart,
      but the absorbing thought of his candidature brought his mind, like a
      compass needle, always round to the same point; howsoever shaken and
      turned about, it came back still to the Academic Pole. And as the wounded
      man smiled at his friends, feeling a little foolish at finding himself,
      for all his cleverness, lying there at full length, Freydet dilated with
      admiration on the &lsquo;proper&rsquo; behaviour of the seconds, whom they had just
      assisted in framing the report, of Doctor Aubouis, who had offered to stay
      with his professional friend, of the Prince, who had gone off in the
      victoria and left for Paul his well-hung carriage, which having only one
      horse could be brought right up to the door of the little building. Every
      one had behaved most properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How he bores one with his proprieties!&rsquo; said Védrine, seeing the face
      Paul had not been able to help making.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It really is very odd,&rsquo; murmured the young fellow in a vague and
      wandering voice. So it would be he, and not the other fellow, whose pale,
      bloodstained face would be seen by the doctors side through the window of
      the brougham as it went slowly home. Well, he had made a mess of it!
      Suddenly he sat up, in spite of the doctor&rsquo;s protest, rummaged in his
      card-case for a card, and scribbled on it with pencil in a shaky hand,
      &lsquo;Fate is as faithless as man. I wanted to avenge you, but could not.
      Forgive me.&rsquo; He signed his name, read it over, reflected, read it again,
      then fastened up the envelope, which they had found in a dusty drawer, a
      nasty scented envelope from some rural stores, and directed it to the
      Duchess Padovani. He gave it to Freydet, begging him to deliver it himself
      as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It shall be there within an hour, my dear Paul.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He made with his hand a sign of thanks and dismissal, then stretched
      himself out, shut his eyes, and lay quiet and still till the departure,
      listening to the sound which came from the sunny meadow around&mdash;a
      vast shrill hum of insects, which imitated the pulsation of approaching
      fever. Beneath the closed lids his thoughts pursued the windings of this
      second and quite novel plot, conceived by a sudden inspiration on &lsquo;the
      place of defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it a sudden inspiration? There perhaps the ambitious young man was
      wrong; for the spring of our actions is often unseen, lost and hidden amid
      the internal disturbance of the crisis, even as the agitator who starts a
      crowd himself disappears in it. A human being resembles a crowd; both are
      manifold, complicated things, full of confused and irregular impulses, but
      there is an agitator in the background; and the movements of a man, like
      those of a mob, passionate and spontaneous as they may appear, have always
      been preconcerted. Since the evening when on the terrace of the Hôtel
      Padovani Lavaux had suggested the Duchess to the young Guardsman, the
      thought had occurred to Paul that, if Madame de Rosen failed him, he might
      fall back on the fair Antonia. It had recurred two nights ago at the
      Français, when he saw Adriani in the Duchess&rsquo;s box; but it took no
      definite shape, because all his energy was then turned in another
      direction, and he still believed in the possibility of success. Now that
      the game was completely lost, his first idea on returning to life was &lsquo;the
      Duchess.&rsquo; Thus, although he scarcely knew it, the resolution reached so
      abruptly was but the coming to light of what grew slowly underground. &lsquo;I
      wanted to avenge you, but could not.&rsquo; Warm-hearted, impulsive, and
      revengeful as he knew her to be, &lsquo;Mari&rsquo; Anto,&rsquo; as her Corsicans called
      her, would certainly be at his bedside the next morning. It would be his
      business to see that she did not go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Védrine and Freydet went back together in the landau, without waiting for
      Sammy&rsquo;s brougham, which had to come slowly for the sake of the wounded
      man. The sight of the swords lying in their baize cover on the empty seat
      opposite suggested reflection. &lsquo;They don&rsquo;t rattle so much as they did
      going, the brutes,&rsquo; said Védrine, kicking them as he spoke. &lsquo;Ah, you see
      they are his!&rsquo; said Freydet, giving words to his thoughts. Then, resuming
      the air of gravity and propriety appropriate to a second, he added, &lsquo;We
      had everything in our favour, the ground, the weapons, and a first rate
      fencer. As he says, it is very odd.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently there was a pause in the dialogue, while their attention was
      fixed by the gorgeous colour of the river, spread in sheets of green and
      purple under the setting sun. Crossing the bridge the horses trotted fast
      up the street of Boulogne. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Védrine went on, as if there had been no
      long interruption of silence; &lsquo;yes, after all, in spite of apparent
      successes, the fellow is unlucky at bottom. I have now seen him more than
      once fighting with circumstances in one of those crises which are
      touchstones to a man&rsquo;s fate, and bring out of him all the luck he has.
      Well, let him plot as cunningly as he will, foresee everything, mix his
      tints with the utmost skill, something gives way at the last moment, and
      without completely ruining him prevents him from attaining his object.
      Why? Very likely, just because his nose is crooked. I assure you, that
      sort of crookedness is nearly always the sign of a twist in the intellect,
      an obliquity in the character. The helm&rsquo;s not straight, you see!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They laughed at the suggestion; and Védrine, pursuing the subject of good
      and bad luck, told an odd story of a thing which had happened almost under
      his eyes when he was staying with the Padovani in Corsica. It was on the
      coast at Barbicaglia, just opposite the lighthouse on the Sanguinaires. In
      this lighthouse lived an old keeper, a tried servant, just on the eve of
      retirement. One night when he was on duty the old fellow fell asleep and
      dozed for five minutes at the most, stopping with his outstretched leg the
      movement of the revolving light, which ought to change colour once a
      minute. That very night, just at that moment, the inspector-general, who
      was making his annual round in a Government boat, happened to be opposite
      the Sanguinaires. He was amazed to see a stationary light, had the boat
      stopped, investigated and reported the matter, and the next morning the
      official boat brought a new keeper to the island and notice of instant
      dismissal to the poor old man. &lsquo;It seems to me,&rsquo; said Védrine, &lsquo;a
      curiosity in ill-luck that, in the chances of darkness, time, and space,
      the inspector&rsquo;s survey should have coincided with the old man&rsquo;s nap.&rsquo; 
      Their carriage was just reaching the Place de la Concorde, and Védrine
      pointed with one of his slow calm movements to a great piece of sky
      overhead where the dark green colour was pierced here and there by
      newly-appearing stars, visible in the waning light of the glorious day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later the landau turned into the Rue de Poitiers, a short
      street, already in shadow, and stopped in front of the high iron gates
      bearing the Padovani shield. All the shutters of the house were closed,
      and there was a great chattering of birds in the garden. The Duchess had
      gone for the summer to Mousseaux. Freydet stood hesitating, with the huge
      envelope in his hand. He had expected to see the fair Antonia and give a
      graphic account of the duel, perhaps even to slip in a reference to his
      approaching candidature. Now he could not make up his mind whether he
      should leave the letter, or deliver it himself a few days hence, when he
      went back to Clos Jallanges. Eventually he decided to leave it, and as he
      stepped back into the carriage he said, &lsquo;Poor fellow! He impressed upon me
      that the letter was urgent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite so,&rsquo; said Védrine, as the landau carried them along the quays, now
      beginning to glimmer with rows of yellow lights, to the meeting place
      arranged with D&rsquo;Athis&rsquo;s seconds; &lsquo;quite so. I don&rsquo;t know what the letter
      is about, but for him to take the trouble to write it at such a moment, it
      must be something very smart, something extremely ingenious and clever.
      Only there you are! Very urgent&mdash;and the Duchess has left.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And pushing the end of his nose on one side between two fingers, he said
      with the utmost gravity, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what it is, you see.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sword-thrust which had so nearly cost Paul Astier his life made peace
      for the time between his parents. In the emotion produced by such a shock
      to his natural feelings, the father forgave all; and as for three weeks
      Madame Astier remained with her patient, coming home only on flying visits
      to fetch linen or change her dress, there was no risk of the covert
      allusions and indirect reproaches, which will revive, even after
      forgiveness and reconciliation, the disagreement of husband and wife. And
      when Paul got well and went, at the urgent invitation of the Duchess, to
      Mousseaux, the return of this truly academic household, if not to warm
      affection, at least to the equable temperature of the &lsquo;cold bed,&rsquo; was
      finally secured by its establishment in the Institute, in the official
      lodgings vacated by Loisillon, whose widow, having been appointed manager
      of the school of Ecouen, removed so quickly, that the new secretary began
      to move in within a very few days of his election.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a long process to settle in rooms which they had surveyed for
      years with the minute exactness of envy and hope, till they knew the very
      utmost that could be made of every corner. The pieces of furniture from
      the Rue de Beaune fell into the new arrangement so smartly, that it looked
      as if they were merely returning after a sojourn in the country, and
      finding their fixed habitat and natural place of adhesion by the marks of
      their own forms upon the floors or panels. The redecoration was limited to
      cleaning the room in which Loisillon died, and papering what had been the
      reception-room of Villemain and was now taken by Astier for his study,
      because there was a good light from the quiet court and a lofty bright
      little room, immediately adjoining, for his MSS., which were transferred
      there in three journeys of a cab, with the help of Fage the bookbinder.

    <p>
      Every morning, with a fresh delight, he enjoyed the convenience of a
      &lsquo;library&rsquo; scarcely inferior to the Foreign Office, which he could enter
      without stooping or climbing a ladder. Of his kennel in the Rue de Beaune
      he could not now think without anger and disgust. It is the nature of man
      to regard places in which he has felt pain with an obstinate and unforgiving
      dislike. We can reconcile ourselves to living creatures, which are capable
      of alteration and differences of aspect, but not to the stony
      unchange-ableness of things. Amid the pleasures of getting in, Astier-Réhu
      could forget his indignation at the offence of his wife, and even his
      grievances against Teyssèdre, who received orders to come every Wednesday
      morning as before. But at the mere remembrance of the slope-roofed den,
      into which he was lately banished for one day in each week, the historian
      ground his teeth, and the jaw of &lsquo;Crocodilus&rsquo; reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teyssèdre, incredible as it may be, was very little excited or impressed
      by the honour of polishing the monumental floors of the Palais Mazarin,
      and still shoved about the table, papers, and numberless refaits of the
      Permanent Secretary with the calm superiority of a citizen of Riom over a
      common fellow from &lsquo;Chauvagnat.&rsquo; Astier-Réhu, secretly uncomfortable under
      this crushing contempt, sometimes tried to make the savage feel the
      dignity of the place upon which his wax-cake was operating. &lsquo;Teyssèdre,&rsquo; 
      said he to him, one morning, &lsquo;this was the reception-room of the great
      Villemain. Pray treat it accordingly;&rsquo; but he instantly offered
      satisfaction to the Arvernian&rsquo;s pride by saying weakly to Corentine, &lsquo;Give
      the good man a glass of wine.&rsquo; The astonished Corentine brought it, and
      the polisher, leaning on his stick, emptied it at a draught, his pupils
      dilating with pleasure. Then he wiped his mouth with his sleeve and,
      setting down the glass with the mark of his greedy lips upon it, said,
      &lsquo;Look you, <i>Meuchieu Astier</i>, a glass of good wine is the only real
      good in life.&rsquo; There was such a ring of truth in his voice, such a sparkle
      of contentment in his eyes, that the Permanent Secretary, going back into
      his library, shut the door a little sharply.
    </p>

      It was scarcely worth while to have scrambled from his low beginning to
      his present glory as head of literature, historian of the &lsquo;House of
      Orleans,&rsquo; and keystone of the Académie Française, if a glass of good wine
      could give to a boor a happiness worth it all. But the next minute,
      hearing the polisher say with a sneer to Corentine that &lsquo;mooch &lsquo;e cared
      for the &lsquo;ception-room of the great Villemain,&rsquo; Léonard Astier shrugged his
      shoulders, and at the thought of such ignorance his half-felt envy gave
      way to a deep and benign compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Madame Astier, who had been brought up in the building, and
      recognised with remembrances of her childhood every stone in the court and
      every step in the dusty and venerable Staircase B, felt as if she had at
      last got back to her home. She had, moreover, a sense far keener than her
      husband&rsquo;s of the material advantages of the place. Nothing to pay for
      rent, for lighting, for fires, a great saving upon the parties of the
      winter season, to say nothing of the increase of income and the
      influential connection, so particularly valuable in procuring orders for
      her beloved Paul. Madame Loisillon in her time, when sounding the praises
      of her apartments at the Institute, never failed to add with emphasis, &lsquo;I
      have entertained there even Sovereigns.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, in the <i>little</i> room,&rsquo; 
      good Adelaide would answer tartly, drawing up her long neck. It was the
      fact that not unfrequently, after the prolonged fatigue of a Special
      Session, some great lady, a Royal Highness on her travels, or a leader
      influential in politics, would go upstairs to pay a little particular
      visit to the wife of the Permanent Secretary. To this sort of hospitality
      Madame Loisillon was indebted for her present appointment as
      school-manager, and Madame Astier would certainly not be less clever than
      her predecessor in utilising the convenience. The only drawback to her
      triumph was her quarrel with the Duchess, which made it impossible for her
      to follow Paul to Mousseaux. But an invitation, opportunely arriving at
      this moment, enabled her to get as near to him as the house at Clos
      Jallanges; and she had hopes of recovering in time the favour of the fair
      Antonia, towards whom, when she saw her so kind to Paul she began again to
      feel quite affectionate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Léonard could not leave Paris, having to work off the arrears of business
      left by Loisillon. He let his wife go however, and promised to come down
      to their friends for a few hours now and then, though in truth he was
      resolved not to separate himself from his beloved Institute. It was so
      comfortable and quiet! He had to attend two meetings in the week, just on
      the other side of the court&mdash;summer meetings, where a friendly party
      of five or six &lsquo;tallymen&rsquo; dozed at ease under the warm glass. The rest of
      the week he was entirely free, and the old man employed it industriously
      in correcting the proofs of his &lsquo;Galileo,&rsquo; which, finished at last, was to
      come out at the opening of the season, as well as a second edition of &lsquo;The
      House of Orleans,&rsquo; improved to twice its value by the addition of new and
      unpublished documents. As the world grows old, history, which being but a
      collective memory of the race is liable to all the lapses, losses, and
      weaknesses of memory in the individual, finds it ever more necessary to be
      fortified with authentic texts, and if it would escape the errors of
      senility, must refresh itself at the original springs. With what pride,
      therefore, with what enjoyment did Astier-Réhu, during those hot August
      days, revise the fresh and trustworthy information displayed in his
      beloved pages, as a preparation for returning them to his publisher, with
      the heading on which, for the first time, appeared beneath his name the
      words &lsquo;Secretaire perpétuel de l&rsquo;Académie Française.&rsquo; His eyes were not
      yet accustomed to the title, which dazzled him on each occasion, like the
      sun upon the white courtyard beneath his windows. It was the vast Second
      Court of the Institute, private and majestic, silent, but for sparrows or
      swallows passing rarely overhead, and consecrated by a bronze bust of
      Minerva with ten <i>termini</i> in a row against the back wall, over which
      rose the huge chimney of the adjoining Mint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards four o&rsquo;clock, when the helmeted shadow of the bust was beginning
      to lengthen, the stiff mechanical step of old Jean Réhu woould be heard
      upon the flags. He lived over the Astiers, and went out regularly every
      day for a long walk, watched from a respectful distance by a servant,
      whose arm he persistently refused. Within the barrier of his increasing
      deafness his faculties, under the great heat of this summer, had begun to
      <i>give</i> way, and especially his memory, no longer effectually guided
      by the reminding pins upon the lappets of his coat. He mixed his stories,
      and lost himself, like old Livingstone in the marshes of Central Africa,
      among his recollections, where he scrambled and floundered till some one
      assisted him. Such a humiliation irritated his spleen, and he now
      therefore seldom spoke to anyone, but talked to himself as he went along,
      marking with a sudden stop and a shake of the head the end of an anecdote
      and the inevitable phrase, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a thing that I have seen.&rsquo; But he still
      carried himself upright, and was as fond of a hoax as in the days of the
      Directory. It was his amusement to impose abstinence from wine, abstinence
      from meat, and every ridiculous variety of regimen upon cits enamoured of
      life, crowds of whom wrote to him daily, asking by what diet he had so
      miraculously extended his. He would prescribe sometimes vegetables, milk,
      or cider, sometimes shell-fish exclusively, and meanwhile ate and drank
      without restriction, taking after each meal a siesta, and every evening a
      good turn up and down the floor, audible to Leonard Astier in the room
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months, August and September, had now elapsed since the Permanent
      Secretary came in&mdash;two clear months of fruitful, delightful peace;
      such a pause in the climb of ambition as perhaps in all his life he had
      never enjoyed before. Madame Astier, still at Clos Jallanges, talked of
      returning soon; the sky of Paris showed the grey of the first fogs; the
      Academicians began to come home; the meetings were becoming less sociable;
      and Astier, during his working hours in the reception-room of the great
      Villemain, found it no longer necessary to screen himself with blinds from
      the blazing reflection of the court. He was at his table one afternoon,
      writing to the worthy De Freydet a letter of good news about his
      candidature, when the old cracked door-bell was violently rung. Corentine
      had just gone out, so he went to the door, where, to his astonishment, he
      was confronted by Baron Huchenard and Bos the dealer in manuscripts. Bos
      dashed into the study wildly waving his arms, while breathless
      ejaculations flew out of his red tangle of beard and hair: &lsquo;Forged! The
      documents are forged! I can prove it! I can prove it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Astier-Réhu, not understanding at first, looked at the Baron, who looked
      at the ceiling. But when he had picked up the meaning of the dealer&rsquo;s
      outcry&mdash;that the three autograph letters of Charles V., sold by
      Madame Astier to Bos and by him transferred to Huchenard, were asserted
      not to be genuine&mdash;he said with a disdainful smile, that he would
      readily repurchase them, as he regarded them with a confidence not to be
      affected by any means whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Allow me, Mr. Secretary, allow me. I would ask you,&rsquo; said Baron
      Huchenard, slowly unbuttoning his macintosh as he spoke, and drawing the
      three documents out of a large envelope, &lsquo;to observe this.&rsquo; The parchments
      were so changed as scarcely to seem the same; their smoky brown was
      bleached to a perfect whiteness; and upon each, clear and legible in the
      middle of the page, below the signature of Charles V., was this mark,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 BB.

           Angoulême 1836.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was Delpech, the Professor of Chemistry, our learned colleague of the
      Académie des Sciences, who&mdash;&rsquo; but of the Baron&rsquo;s explanation nothing
      but a confused murmur reached poor Léonard. There was no colour in his
      face, nor a drop of blood left at the tips of the big heavy fingers, in
      whose hold the three autographs shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The 800L. shall be at your house this evening, M. Bos,&rsquo; he managed to say
      at last with what moisture was left in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bos protested and appealed. The Baron had given him 900L.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;900L., then,&rsquo; said Astier-Réhu, making a great effort to show them out.
      But in the dimly-lighted hall he kept back his colleague, and begged him
      humbly, as a Member of the Académie des Inscriptions, and for the honour
      of the whole Institute, to say nothing of this unlucky affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, my dear sir, certainly, on one condition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Name it, name it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will shortly receive notice that I am a candidate for Loisillon&rsquo;s
      chair.&rsquo; The Secretary&rsquo;s answer was a firm clasp of hand in hand, which
      pledged the assistance of himself and his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once alone, the unhappy man sank down before the table with its load of
      proofs, on which lay outspread the three forged letters to Rabelais. He
      gazed at them blankly, and mechanically read: &lsquo;<i>Maître Rabelais, vous
      qu&rsquo;avez l&rsquo;esprit fin et subtil!</i>&rsquo; The characters seemed to go round and
      round in a mixture of ink, dissolved into broad blots of sulphate of iron,
      which to his imagination went on spreading, till they reached his whole
      collection of originals, ten or twelve thousand, all unhappily got from
      the same quarter. Since these three were forged, what of his &lsquo;Galileo&rsquo;?&mdash;what
      of his &lsquo;House of Orleans&rsquo;?&mdash;the letter of Catherine II. which he had
      presented to the Grand Duke?&mdash;the letter of Rotrou, which he had
      solemnly bestowed upon the Académie? What? What? A spasm of energy brought
      him to his legs. Fage! He must at once see Fage!
    </p>
    <p>
      His dealings with the bookbinder had begun some years before, when the
      little man had come one day to the Library of the Foreign Office to
      request the opinion of its learned and illustrious Keeper respecting a
      letter from Marie de Médicis to Pope Urban VIII. in favour of Galileo. It
      happened that Petit-Séquard had just announced as forthcoming, among a
      series of short light volumes on history, entitled &lsquo;Holiday Studies,&rsquo; a
      &lsquo;Galileo&rsquo; by Astier-Réhu of the Académie Française. When therefore the
      librarian&rsquo;s trained judgment had assured him that the MS. was genuine, and
      he was told that Fage possessed also the letter of the Pope in reply, a
      letter of thanks from Galileo to the Queen, and others, he conceived
      instantaneously the idea of writing, instead of the &lsquo;slight trifle,&rsquo; a
      great historical work. But his probity suggesting at the same moment a
      doubt as to the source of these documents, he looked the dwarf steadily in
      the face, and after examining, as he would have examined an original, the
      long pallid visage and the reddened, blinking eye-lids, said, with an
      inquisitorial snap of the jaw, &lsquo;Are these manuscripts your own, M. Fage?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no, sir,&rsquo; said Fage. He was merely acting on behalf of a third person,
      an old maiden lady of good birth, who was obliged to part gradually with a
      very fine collection, which had belonged to the family ever since Louis
      XVI. Nor had he been willing to act, till he had taken the opinion of a
      scholar of the highest learning and character. Now, relying upon so
      competent a judgment, he should go to rich collectors, such as Baron
      Huchenard, for instance&mdash;but Astier-Réhu stopped him, saying, &lsquo;Do not
      trouble yourself. Bring me all you have relating to Galileo. I can dispose
      of it.&rsquo; People were coming in and taking their places at the little
      tables, the sort of people who prowl and hunt in libraries, colourless and
      taciturn as diggers from the mines, with an air as if they had themselves
      been dug up out of somewhere close and damp. &lsquo;Come to my private room,
      upstairs, not here,&rsquo; whispered the librarian in the big ear of the
      humpback as he moved away, displaying his gloves, oiled hair, and middle
      parting with the self-sufficiency often observable in his species.
    </p>
    <p>
      The collection of Mademoiselle du Mesnil-Case, a name disclosed by Albin
      Fage only under solemn promise of secrecy, proved to be an inexhaustible
      treasure of papers relating to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
      which threw all sorts of interesting lights upon the past, and sometimes,
      by a word or a date, overturned completely the established opinions about
      facts or persons. Whatever the price, Léonard Astier took and kept every
      one of the documents, which almost always fitted in with his commenced or
      projected works. Without a shadow of doubt he accepted the little man&rsquo;s
      account of the masses of originals that were still accumulating dust in
      the attic of an ancient mansion at Ménilmontant. If, after some venomous
      criticism from &lsquo;the first collector&rsquo; in France, his trust was slightly
      disturbed the suspicion could not but vanish when the book-binder, seated
      at his table or watering his vegetables in the quiet grass-grown yard, met
      it with perfect composure, and offered in particular a quite natural
      explanation of certain marks of erasure and restoration, visible on some
      of the pages, as due to the submergence of the collection in sea-water,
      when it was sent to England during the emigration. After this fresh
      assurance Astier-Réhu would go back to the gate with a lively step,
      carrying off each time a purchase for which he had given, according to its
      historical value, a cheque for twenty, forty, or even as much as eighty
      pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      These extravagances, unsuspected as yet by those around him, were
      prompted, whatever he might say to quiet his conscience, not so much by
      the motives of the historian as by those of the collector. This, even in a
      place so ill-adapted for seeing and hearing as the attic in the Rue de
      Beaune, where the bargains were usually struck, would have been patent to
      any observer. The tone of pretended indifference, the &lsquo;Let me see&rsquo; 
      muttered with dry lips, the quivering of the covetous fingers, marked the
      progress from passion to mania, the growth of the hard and selfish cyst,
      which was feeding its monstrous size upon the ruin of the whole organism.
      Astier was becoming the intractable Harpagon of the stage, pitiless to
      others as to himself, bewailing his poverty and riding in the omnibus,
      while in two years nearly 6500L. of his savings dropped secretly into the
      pocket of the humpback. To account to Madame Astier, Corentine, and
      Teyssèdre for the frequent visits of the little man, he received from the
      Academician pamphlets to bind, which he took away and brought back
      ostentatiously. They corresponded by a sort of private code. Fage would
      write on a post-card, &lsquo;I have some new tooling to show you, sixteenth
      century, in good condition and rare.&rsquo; Astier would temporise: &lsquo;Not wanted,
      thanks. Perhaps later.&rsquo; Then would come &lsquo;My dear Sir, Do not think of it.
      I will try elsewhere,&rsquo; and to this the Academician invariably answered
      &lsquo;Early to-morrow morning. Bring the tooling.&rsquo; Here was the torment of the
      collector&rsquo;s pleasure. He must buy and buy, or else let pass to Bos,
      Huchenard, or some other rival the treasures of Ménilmontant. Sometimes
      the thought of the time when money must fail would put him into a grim
      rage, and infuriated by the calm, self-satisfied countenance of the dwarf,
      he would exclaim &lsquo;More than 6400L. in two years! And still you say, the
      lady is in want of money! How on earth does she get rid of it? &lsquo;At such
      moments he longed for the death of the old maid, the annihilation of the
      bookbinder, even a war, revolution, or general catastrophe, which might
      swallow up both the treasure and the relentless speculators who worked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the catastrophe was indeed near, not the catastrophe desired, for
      destiny never finds to her hand precisely the thing we asked for, but a
      turn of things so sudden and appalling as to threaten his work, his
      honour, fortune, and fame, all that he was and all that he had. As he
      strode away towards the Cour des Comptes, deadly pale and talking to
      himself, the booksellers and print-dealers along the quay scarcely
      recognised the Astier-Réhu who, instead of looking right into the shop for
      a bow, now passed them without recognition. To him neither person nor
      thing was visible. In imagination he was grasping the humpback by the
      throat, shaking him by his pin-bespangled scarf, and thrusting under his
      nose the autographs dishonoured by the chemistry of Delpech, with the
      question, &lsquo;Now then, what is your answer to that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the Rue de Lille, he dashed through the door of rough
      planks in the fence which surrounds the ruins, went up the steps, and rang
      the bell once and again. He was struck by the gloomy look of the building,
      now that no flowers or greenery covered the nakedness of the gaping,
      crumbling masonry and the confusion of the twisted iron-work and leafless
      creepers. The sound of pattens came slowly across the chilly court, and
      the caretaker appeared, a solid woman, who, broom in hand and without
      opening the gate, said, &lsquo;You want the bookbinder; but he isn&rsquo;t here now.&rsquo; 
      Not here! Yes, Fage had gone, and left no address. In fact, she was just
      cleaning up the cottage for the man who was to have the appointment to the
      Cour des Comptes, which Fage had resigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astier-Réhu, for appearance&rsquo; sake, stammered out a word or two, but his
      voice was lost in the harsh and mournful cries of a great flight of black
      birds, which made the arches echo as they descended upon the court. &lsquo;Why,
      here are the Duchess&rsquo;s rooks!&rsquo; said the woman, with a respectful wave of
      the hand towards the bare plane-trees of the Hôtel Padovani, visible over
      the roof opposite. &lsquo;They are come before the Duchess this year, and that
      means an early winter!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away, with horror in his heart.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day following that on which the Duchess Padovani, to show herself
      smiling under the blow which had fallen upon her, had appeared at the
      theatre, she went, as she usually did at that time of year, to Mousseaux.
      She made no change in her plans. She had sent out her invitations for the
      season, and did not cancel them. But before the arrival of the first
      instalment of visitors, during the few days&rsquo; solitude usually spent in
      superintending in detail the arrangements for entertaining her guests, she
      passed the whole time from morning to night in the park at Mousseaux,
      whose slopes stretched far and wide on the banks of the Loire. She would
      go madly along, like a wounded and hunted animal, stop for a moment from
      exhaustion, and then at a throb of pain start off again. &lsquo;Coward! coward!
      wretch!&rsquo; She hurled invectives at the Prince as though he had been by her
      side, and still she walked with the same fevered tread the labyrinth of
      green paths which ran down in long shady windings to the river. Here,
      forgetting her rank and her position, flinging off her mask and able to be
      natural at last, she would give vent to her despair, a despair perhaps
      something less than her wrath, for the voice of pride spoke louder within
      her than any other, and the few tears which escaped her lids did not flow,
      but leaped and sparkled like flames. Revenge, revenge! She longed for a
      revenge of blood, and sometimes pictured one of her foresters, Bertoli or
      Salviato, going off abroad to put a bullet into him on his wedding-day.
      Then she changed her mind. No, she would deal the blow herself, and feel
      the joy of the <i>vendetta</i> in her own grasp. She envied the women of
      lower class who wait behind a doorway for the traitor, and fling in his
      face a bottle full of vitriol with a storm of hideous curses. Why did she
      not know some of the horrible names that relieve the heart, some foul
      insult to shriek at the mean treacherous companion who rose before her
      mind with the hesitating look and false constrained smile he wore at their
      last meeting? But even in her savage Corsican patois the great lady knew
      no &lsquo;nasty words,&rsquo; and when she had cried &lsquo;Coward! coward! wretch!&rsquo; her
      beautiful mouth could only writhe in helpless rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening after her solitary dinner in the vast hall, whose panelling
      of old leather was gilt by the setting sun, her wild pacing to and fro
      began again. Now it was on the gallery overhanging the river, quaintly
      restored by Paul Astier, with open arcades like lace-work and two pretty
      corbel-turrets. Below on the Loire, outspread like a lake, there still
      lingered a delicate silvery light from the departing day, while the hazy
      evening air exaggerated the distances between the willow beds and islands
      out towards Chaumont. But poor Mari&rsquo; Anto did not look at the view when,
      worn out with retracing the steps of her grief, she leant both elbows on
      the balustrade and gazed into the dimness. Her life appeared before her,
      waste and desolate, at an age when it is difficult to make a fresh start.
      A faint sound of voices rose from Mousseaux, a group of two or three small
      houses on the embankment; the chain of a boat creaked as the night breeze
      rose. How easy it would be! Grief had bowed down her head so low, that if
      she were but to lean forward a little farther.... But then what would the
      world say? A woman of her rank and age could not kill herself like any
      little grisette! The third day Paul&rsquo;s note arrived, and with it the
      newspapers&rsquo; detailed report of the duel. It gave her the same delight as a
      warm pressure of the hand. So some one still cared for her, and had wanted
      to avenge her at the risk of his life! Not that Paul&rsquo;s feeling was love,
      she supposed, but only a grateful affection, the reminiscence of
      kindnesses done by her to him and his family, perhaps an imperative desire
      to atone for his mother&rsquo;s treachery. Generous, brave fellow! If she had
      been in Paris, she would have gone to him at once, but as her guests were
      just due, she could only write and send him her own doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every hour came fresh arrivals from Blois and from Onzain, Mousseaux lying
      half way between the two stations. The landau, the victoria, and two great
      breaks set down at the steps in the great court, amid the incessant
      ringing of the bell, many illustrious members of the Duchess&rsquo;s set,
      academicians and diplomatists, the Count and Countess Foder, the Comte de
      Brétigny and his son the Vicomte, who was a Secretary of Legation, M. and
      Madame Desminières, Laniboire the philosopher, who had come to the castle
      to draw up his report on the award of the <i>Prix de vertu</i>, the young
      critic of Shelley, who was &lsquo;run&rsquo; by the Padovani set, and Danjou, handsome
      Danjou, all by himself, though his wife had been asked. Life at Mousseaux
      was exactly what it had been the year before. The day passed in calls, or
      work in the separate rooms, meals, general conversation, afternoon naps;
      then, when the great heat was passed, came long drives through the woods,
      or sails on the river in the little fleet of boats anchored at the bottom
      of the park. Parties would be made to picnic on an island, and some of the
      guests would repair to the fish preserves, which were always well stocked
      with lively fish, as the keeper took care to replenish them from his nets
      before each expedition. Then every one came back to the ceremonious
      dinner, after which the gentlemen, when they had smoked in the billiard
      room or on the gallery, joined the ladies in a splendid apartment, which
      had been the council-chamber of Catherine de Médicis.
    </p>
    <p>
      All round the huge room were depicted in tapestry the loves of Dido and
      her despair at the departure of the Trojan ships. The irony of this
      strange coincidence was not remarked by any one, so little do people in
      society regard their surroundings, less for want of observation than
      because they are always and fully occupied with their personal behaviour
      and the effect they are to produce. But there was a striking contrast
      between the tragic despair of the abandoned queen, gazing with arms
      uplifted and streaming eyes as the little black speck disappeared, and the
      smiling serenity of the Duchess, as she presided in the drawing-room,
      maintaining her supremacy over the other ladies, whose dress and whose
      reading were guided by her taste, or joining in the discussions between
      Laniboire and the young critic, and in the disputes waged over the
      candidates for Loisillon&rsquo;s seat by Desminières and Danjou. Indeed, if the
      Prince d&rsquo;Athis, the faithless Sammy, whose name was in every one&rsquo;s
      thoughts, though on no one&rsquo;s lips, could have seen her, he would have been
      mortified to find how small was the gap left in a woman&rsquo;s life by
      his-absence, and how busy was the turmoil throughout the royal castle of
      Mousseaux, where in all the long front there were but three windows shut
      up, those belonging to what were called &lsquo;the Prince&rsquo;s rooms.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She takes it well,&rsquo; said Danjou the first evening. And neither little
      Countess Foder, from whose massy lace protruded a very sharp inquisitive
      little nose, nor sentimental Madame Desminières, who had looked forward to
      lamentations and confidences, could get over such amazing courage. In
      truth they were as much amazed at her as if going to a long-expected play
      they had found the house &lsquo;closed for the day&rsquo;; while the men took
      Ariadne&rsquo;s equanimity as an encouragement to would-be successors. The real
      change in the Duchess&rsquo;s life lay in the attitude observed towards her by
      all or nearly all the men; they were less reserved, more sedulous, more
      eager to please her, and fluttered round her chair with an obvious desire,
      not merely to merit her patronage, but to attract her regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never indeed had Maria Antonia been more beautiful. When she entered the
      dining-room the tempered brilliancy of her complexion and her shoulders in
      their light summer robe made a bright place at the table, even when the
      Marquise de Roca Nera had come over from her neighbouring country seat on
      the other side of the Loire. The Marquise was younger, but no one would
      have thought so to look at them. Laniboire, the philosopher, was strongly
      attracted to the Duchess. He was a widower, well on in years, with heavy
      features and apoplectic complexion, but he did his best to captivate his
      hostess by the display of a manly and sportsmanlike activity which led him
      into occasional mishaps. One day, in a boat, as he tried to make a great
      display of biceps over his rowing, he fell into the river; another time,
      as he was prancing on horseback at the side of the carriage, his mount
      squeezed his leg so hard against the wheel that he had to keep his room
      and be bandaged for several days. But the finest spectacle was to see him
      in the drawing-room, &lsquo;dancing,&rsquo; as Danjou said, &lsquo;before the Ark.&rsquo; He
      stretched and bent his unwieldy person in all directions. He would
      challenge to a philosophic duel the young critic, a confirmed pessimist of
      three-and-twenty, and overwhelm him with his own imperturbable optimism.
      Laniboire the philosopher had one particular reason for this good opinion
      of the world; his wife had died of diphtheria caught from nursing their
      children; both his children had died with their mother; and each time that
      he repeated his dithyramb in praise of existence, the philosopher
      concluded his statement with a sort of practical demonstration, a bow to
      the Duchess, which seemed to say, &lsquo;How can a man think ill of life in the
      presence of such beauty as yours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young critic paid his court in a less conspicuous and sufficiently
      cunning fashion. He was an immense admirer of the Prince d&rsquo;Athis, and
      being at the age when admiration shows itself by imitation, he no sooner
      made his entry into society than he copied Sammy&rsquo;s attitudes, his walk,
      even the carriage of his head, his bent back, and vague mysterious smile
      of contemptuous reserve. Now he increased the resemblance by details of
      dress, which he had observed and collected with the sharpness of a child,
      from the way of pinning his tie just at the opening of the collar to the
      fawn-coloured check of his English trousers. Unfortunately he had too much
      hair and not a scrap of beard, so that his efforts were quite thrown away,
      and revived no uncomfortable memories in the Duchess, who was as
      indifferent to his English checks as she was to the languishing glances of
      Brétigny <i>fils</i>, or the significant pressure of Brétigny <i>père</i>,
      as he gave her his arm to dinner. But all this helped to surround her with
      that atmosphere of gallantry to which she had long been accustomed by
      D&rsquo;Athis, who played the humble servant to the verge of servility, and to
      save her woman&rsquo;s pride from the conscious humiliation of abandonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst all these aspirants Danjou kept somewhat aloof, amusing the Duchess
      with his green-room stories and making her laugh, a way of
      self-recommendation in certain cases not unsuccessful. But the time came
      when he thought matters sufficiently advanced: and one morning when she
      was starting for her rapid solitary walk with her dogs through the park,
      in the hope of leaving her wrath behind in the thickets with the waking
      birds, or of cooling and tempering it among the dewy lawns and dripping
      branches&mdash;suddenly, at a turn in the path, appeared Danjou, ready for
      the attack. Dressed from head to foot in white flannels, his trousers
      tucked into his boots, with a picturesque cap and a well-trimmed beard, he
      was trying to find a <i>dénouement</i> for a three-act drama, to be ready
      for the Français that winter. The name was &lsquo;Appearances,&rsquo; and the subject
      a satire on society. Everything was written but the final scene.

      <img src="images/254.jpg" width="100%"
       alt="He Began to Talk of his Love 254 " />
    </div>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, let us try what we can do together,&rsquo; said the Duchess brightly, as
      she cracked the long lash of the short-handled whip with silver whistle,
      which she used to call in her dogs. But the moment they turned to walk
      together, he began to talk of his love, and how sad it would be for her to
      live alone; and ended by offering himself, after his own fashion, straight
      out and with no circumlocutions. The Duchess, with a quick movement of
      pride, threw up her head, grasping her whip handle tightly, as if to
      strike the insolent fellow who dared to talk to her as he might to a super
      at the opera. But the insult was also a compliment, and there was pleasure
      as well as anger in her blush. Danjou steadily urged his point, and tried
      to dazzle her with his polished wit, pretending to treat the matter less
      as a love affair than as an intellectual partnership. A man like himself
      and a woman like her might command the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Many thanks, my dear Danjou; such specious reasoning is not new to me. I
      am suffering from it still.&rsquo; Then with a haughty wave of her hand, which
      allowed no reply, she pointed out the shady path which the dramatist was
      to follow, and said, &lsquo;Look for your <i>dénouement</i>; I am going in.&rsquo; He
      stood where he was, completely disconcerted, and gazed at her beautiful
      carriage as she walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not even as zebra?&rsquo; he said, in a tone of appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked round, her black brows meeting. &lsquo;Ah, yes, you are right; the
      post is vacant,&rsquo; Her thoughts went to Lavaux, the base underling for whom
      she had done so much, and without a smile she answered in a weary voice,
      &lsquo;Zebra, if you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she vanished behind a little group of fine yellow roses a little
      overblown, whose leaves would be scattered at the first fresh breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was something to boast of that the proud Mari&rsquo; Anto&rsquo; had heard him
      through. Probably no other man, not even her Prince, had ever spoken to
      her thus. Full of the inspiration of hope, and stimulated by the fine
      speeches he had just thrown off, the dramatist soon hit upon his final
      scene. He was going back to write it out before breakfast, when he stopped
      short in surprise at seeing through the branches &lsquo;the Prince&rsquo;s&rsquo; windows
      open to the sunlight Who was coming? What favourite guest was to be
      honoured with those convenient and luxurious rooms, looking over the river
      and the park? He made inquiries, and was reassured. It was her Grace&rsquo;s
      architect; he was coming to the castle after an illness. Considering the
      intimacy between the lady and the Astiers, nothing was more natural than
      that Paul should be entertained like a son of the house in a mansion which
      he had more or less created. Still, when the new arrival took his seat at
      breakfast, his chastened delicacy of feature, his paleness&mdash;the paler
      by a white silk kerchief&mdash;his duel, his wound, and the general
      flavour of romance surrounding him seemed to make so keen an impression on
      the ladies, and called forth such affectionate interest and care on the
      part of the Duchess herself, that handsome Danjou, being one of those
      all-engrossing persons to whom any other man&rsquo;s success seems a personal
      loss, if not downright robbery, felt a jealous pang. With his eyes on his
      plate he took advantage of his position by the hostess to murmur some
      depreciatory remarks upon the pretty young fellow, unfortunately so much
      disfigured by his mother&rsquo;s nose. He made merry over his duel, his wound,
      and his reputation in the fencing-room, the kind of bubble which bursts at
      the first prick of a real sword. He added, not knowing how near he was to
      the truth, &lsquo;The quarrel at cards was of course a mere pretext; there was a
      woman at the bottom of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of the duel? Do you think so?&rsquo; His nod said &lsquo;I am sure of it.&rsquo; Much
      admiring his own cleverness, he turned to the company, and dazzled them
      with his epigrams and anecdotes. He never went into society without
      providing himself with a store of these pocket squibs. Paul was no match
      for him here, and the ladies&rsquo; interest soon reverted to the brilliant
      talker, especially when he announced that, having got his <i>dénouement</i>
      and finished his play, he would read it in the drawing-room while it was
      too hot to go out. A universal exclamation of delight from the ladies
      welcomed this invaluable relief to the day&rsquo;s monotony. What a precious
      privilege for them, proud as they were already of dating their letters
      from Mousseaux, to be able to send to all their dear friends, who were not
      there, accounts of an unpublished play by Danjou, read by Danjou himself,
      and then next winter to be in a position to say when the rehearsals were
      going on, &lsquo;Oh, Danjou&rsquo;s play! I know it; he read it to us at the castle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the company rose, full of excitement at this good news, the Duchess
      went towards Paul, and taking his arm with her graceful air of command
      said, &lsquo;Come for a turn on the gallery; it is stifling here.&rsquo; The air was
      heavy even at the height of the gallery, for there rose from the steaming
      river a mist of heat, which overspread and blurred the irregular green
      outlines of its banks and of its low floating islands. She led the young
      man away from the smokers right to the end of the furthest bay, and then
      clasping his hand said, &lsquo;So it was for me; it was all for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Duchess, for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he pursed his lips as he added, &lsquo;And presently we shall have another
      try.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must not say that, you naughty boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, as an inquisitive footstep came towards them. Danjou!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Duchess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My fan... on the dining-room table... would you be so kind?...&rsquo; When he
      was some way off, she said, &lsquo;I will not have it, Paul. In the first place,
      the creature is not worth fighting. Ah, if we were alone&mdash;if I could
      tell you!&rsquo; The fierceness of her tone and the clenching of her hands
      betrayed a rage that amazed Paul Astier. After a month he had hoped to
      find her calmer than this. It was a disappointment, and it checked the
      explosion, &lsquo;I love you&mdash;I have always loved you,&rsquo; which was to have
      been forced from him at the first confidential interview. He was only
      telling the story of the duel, in which she was very much interested, when
      the Academician brought her fan. &lsquo;Well fetched, zebra!&rsquo; she said by way of
      thanks. With a little pout he answered in the same strain but a lowered
      voice, &lsquo;A zebra on promotion, you know!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, wanting to be raised already!&rsquo; She tapped him with her fan as she
      spoke, and anxious to put him in a good temper for his reading, let him
      escort her back to the drawing-room, where his manuscript was lying ready
      on a dainty card-table in the full light of a high window partly open,
      showing the flower-garden and the groups of great trees.

      &lsquo;<i>Appearances. A Drama in Three Acts. Dramatis Personæ</i>....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies, getting as close round as they could, drew themselves together
      with the charming little shiver which is their way of anticipating
      enjoyment. Danjou read like a genuine &lsquo;Player&rsquo; of Picheral&rsquo;s
      classification, making lengthy pauses while he moistened his lips with his
      glass of water, and wiped them with a fine cambric handkerchief. As he
      finished each of the long broad pages, scribbled all over with his tiny
      handwriting, he let-it fall carelessly at his feet on the carpet Each time
      Madame de Foder, who hunts the &lsquo;lions&rsquo; of all nations, stooped
      noiselessly, picked up the fallen sheet, and placed it reverently upon an
      armchair beside her, exactly square with the sheets before, contriving, in
      this subtle and delicate way, to take a certain part in the great man&rsquo;s
      work. It was as if Liszt or Rubinstein had been at the piano and she had
      been turning over the music. All went well till the end of Act I., an
      interesting and promising introduction, received with a <i>furore</i> of
      delighted exclamations, rapturous laughter, and enthusiastic applause.
      After a long pause, in which was audible from the far distance of the park
      the hum of the insects buzzing about the tree-tops, the reader wiped his
      moustache, and resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Act II The scene represents</i>... But here his voice began to break,
      and grew huskier with every speech. He had just seen an empty chair among
      the ladies in the first row; it was Antonia&rsquo;s chair; and his glances
      strayed over his eye-glass searching the whole huge room. It was full of
      green plants and screens, behind which the auditors had ensconced
      themselves to hear&mdash;or to sleep&mdash;undisturbed. At last, in one of
      the numerous and regular intervals provided by his glass of water, he
      caught a whisper, then a glimpse of a light dress, then, at the far end,
      on a sofa, he saw the Duchess with Paul beside her, continuing the
      conversation interrupted on the gallery. To one like Danjou, spoiled with
      every kind of success, the affront was deadly. But he nerved himself to
      finish the Act, throwing his pages down on the floor with a violence which
      made them fly, and sent little Madame de Foder crawling after them on all
      fours. At the end of the Act, as the whispering still went on, he left
      off, pretending that he was suddenly taken hoarse and must defer the rest
      till the next day. The Duchess, absorbed in the duel, of which she could
      not hear enough, supposed the play concluded, and cried from the distance,
      clapping her little hands, &lsquo;Bravo, Danjou, the <i>dénouement</i> is
      delicious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening the great man had, or said he had, a bilious attack, and very
      early next morning he left Mousseaux without seeing any one again. Perhaps
      it was only the vexation of an author; perhaps he truly believed that
      young Astier was going to succeed the Prince. However that may be, a week
      after he had gone Paul had not got beyond an occasional whispered word.
      The lady showed him the utmost kindness, treated him with the care of a
      mother, asked after his health, whether he did not find the tower looking
      south too hot, whether the shaking of the carriage tired him, whether it
      was not too late for him to stay on the river. But the moment he tried to
      mention the word &lsquo;love,&rsquo; she was off without seeming to understand. Still
      he found her a very different creature from the proud Antonia of other
      years. Then, haughty and calm, she would show impertinence his place by a
      mere frown. It was the serenity of a majestic river flowing between its
      embankments. But now the embankment was giving way; there seemed to be a
      crack somewhere, through which was breaking the real nature of the woman.
      She had fits of rebellion against custom and social convention, which
      hitherto she had respected scrupulously, sudden desires to go somewhere
      else, and to tire herself in some long excursion. She planned festivities,
      fireworks, great coursing expeditions for the autumn, in which she would
      take the lead, though it was years since she had been on horseback. Paul
      watched carefully the vagaries of her excitement, and kept his sharp
      hawk&rsquo;s-eye upon everything; he had quite made up his mind not to dangle
      for two years, as he had round Colette de Rosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night the party had broken up early, after a tiring day of driving in
      the neighbourhood. Paul had gone up to his room, and having thrown off his
      coat was sitting in his slippers smoking a cigar and writing to his mother
      a carefully studied epistle. Mamma was staying at Clos Jallanges, and
      wearing her eyes out with looking across the winding river into the
      extreme distance for a glimpse of the four towers of Mousseaux: and he had
      to convince her that there was no chance of a reconciliation at present
      between her and her friend, and that they had better not meet. (No, no!
      His good mother was much too fond of fishing on her own hook to be a
      desirable associate!) He had to remind her of the bill due at the end of
      the month, and her promise to send the money to good little Stenne, who
      had been left in the Rue Fortuny as sole garrison of the mediaeval
      mansion. If Sammy&rsquo;s money had not yet come in, she might borrow of the
      Freydets, who would not refuse to advance it for a few days. That very
      morning the Paris papers in their foreign news had announced the marriage
      of the French Ambassador at St. Petersburg, mentioned the presence of the
      Grand Duke, described the bride&rsquo;s dresses, and given the name of the
      Polish Bishop who had bestowed his blessing on the happy pair. Mamma might
      imagine how the breakfast party at Mousseaux was affected by this news,
      known to every one, and read by the hostess in the eyes of her guests and
      in their persistent conversation on other topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor Duchess, who had hardly spoken during the meal, felt, when it was
      over, that she must rouse herself, and in spite of the heat had carried
      off all her visitors in three carriages to the Château de la Poissonnière,
      where the poet Ronsard was born. Ten miles&rsquo; drive in the sun on a road all
      cracks and dust, for the pleasure of hearing that hideous old Lani-boire,
      hoisted on to an old stump as decayed as himself, recite &lsquo;Mignonne, allons
      voir si la rose.&rsquo; On the way home they had paid a visit to the
      Agricultural Orphanage and Training School founded by old Padovani. Mamma
      must know it all well; they had been over the dormitory and laundry, and
      inspected the implements and the copy-books; and the whole place was so
      hot and smelly; and Laniboire made a speech to the Agricultural Orphans,
      cropped like convicts, in which he assured them that the world was good.
      To finish themselves up they stopped again at the furnaces near Onzain,
      and spent an hour between the heat of the setting sun and the smoke and
      smell of coal from three huge belching brick chimneys, stumbling over the
      rails and dodging the trucks and shovels full of molten metal in gigantic
      masses, which dropped fire like dissolving blocks of red ice, All the time
      the Duchess went on unwearied, but looked at nothing, listened to nothing.
      She seemed to be having an animated discussion with old Brétigny, whose
      arm she had taken, and paid as little attention to the furnaces and forges
      as to the poet Ronsard or the Agricultural Orphanage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul had reached this point in his letter, painting with terrible force,
      to console his mother for her absence, the dullness of life this year at
      Mousseaux, when he heard a gentle knock at his door. He thought it was the
      young critic, or the Vicomte de Brétigny, or perhaps Laniboire, who had
      been very unquiet of late. All these had often prolonged the evening in
      his room, which was the largest and most convenient, and had a dainty
      smoking-room attached to it. He was very much surprised on opening his
      door to see by the light of the painted windows that the long corridor of
      the first floor was absolutely silent and deserted, right away to the
      guard-room, where a ray of moonlight showed the outline of the carving on
      the massive door. He was going back to his seat, when there came another
      knock. It came from the smoking-room, which communicated by a little door
      under the hangings with a narrow passage in the thickness of the wall
      leading to the rooms of the Duchess. The arrangement, dating much earlier
      than the restorations, was not known to him: and, as he remembered certain
      conversations during the last few days, when the men were alone, and
      especially some of the stories of old Laniboire, his first thought was
      &lsquo;Whew! I hope she did not hear us.&rsquo; He drew the bolt and the Duchess
      passed him without a word, and laying down on the table where he had been
      writing a bundle of yellowish papers, with which her delicate fingers
      played nervously, she said in a serious voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want you to give me your advice; you are my friend, and I have no one
      else to confide in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No one but him&mdash;poor woman! And she did not take warning from the
      cunning watchful predatory glance, which shifted from the letter,
      imprudently left open on the table where she might have read it, to
      herself as she stood there with her arms bare and heavy hair coiled round
      and round her head. He was thinking, &lsquo;What does she want? What has she
      come for?&rsquo; She, absorbed in the requickened wrath which had been rising
      and choking her since the morning, panted out in low broken sentences,
      &lsquo;Just before you came, he sent Lavaux&mdash;he did! he sent Lavaux&mdash;to
      ask for his letters!&mdash;I gave his impudent cheeks such a reception
      that he won&rsquo;t come again.&mdash;His letters, indeed!&mdash;these are what
      he wanted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out the roll, her brief, as it might be called, against the
      partner of her affections, showing what she had paid to raise the man out
      of the gutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take them, look at them! They are really quite interesting! &lsquo;He turned
      over the odd collection, smelling now of the boudoir, but better suited to
      Bos&rsquo;s shop-front; there were mortgageable debts to dealers in curiosities,
      private jewellers, laundresses, yacht-builders, agents for
      imitation-champagne from Touraine, receipts from stewards and
      club-waiters, in short, every device of usury by which a man about Paris
      comes to bankruptcy. Mari&rsquo; Anto muttered under her breath, &lsquo;The
      restoration of this gentleman cost more than Mousseaux, you see!... I have
      had all these things in a drawer for years, because I never destroy
      anything; but I solemnly declare that. I never thought of using them. Now
      I have changed my mind. He is rich. I want my money and interest. If he
      does not pay, I will take proceedings. Don&rsquo;t you think I am justified?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Entirely justified,&rsquo; said Paul, stroking the point of his fair beard,
      &lsquo;only&mdash;was not the Prince d&rsquo;Athis incapable of contracting when he
      signed these bills?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, I know... Brétigny told me about that... for as he could get
      nothing through Lavaux, he wrote to Brétigny to ask him to arbitrate. A
      fellow Academician, you know!&rsquo; She laughed a laugh of impartial scorn for
      the official dignities of the Ambassador and the ex-Minister. Then she
      burst out indignantly, &lsquo;It is true that I need not have paid, but I chose
      he should be clean. I don&rsquo;t want any arbitration. I paid and will be paid
      back, or else I go into court, where the name and title of our
      representative at St. Petersburg will be dragged through the dirt. If I
      can only degrade the wretch, I shall have won the suit I care about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t understand,&rsquo; said Paul as he put down the packet so as to hide
      the awkward letter to Mamma, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t understand how such proofs should
      have been left in your hands by a man as clever&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As D&rsquo;Athis?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The shrug of her shoulders sufficiently completed the interjection. But
      the madness of a woman&rsquo;s anger may always lead to something, so he drew
      her on. &lsquo;Yet he was one of our best diplomatists.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was I who put him up to it. He knows nothing of the business but what
      I taught him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hid her face, as for shame, in her hands, checking her sobs and
      gasping with fury. &lsquo;To think, to think, twelve years of my life to a man
      like that! And now he leaves me; he casts me off! Cast off by him! Cast
      off by him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is some hours later, and she is still there. The young man is upon his
      knees and is whispering tenderly: &lsquo;When you know that I love you&mdash;when
      you know that I loved you always. Think, think!&rsquo; The striking of a clock
      is heard in the far distance and wakening sounds go by in the growing
      light. She flies in dismay from the room, not caring so much as to take
      with her the brief of her intended revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Revenge herself now? On whom? and what for? There was an end of her hatred
      now, for had she not her love? From this day she was another woman, such
      an one as when she is seen with her lover or her husband, supporting her
      unhasty steps upon the tender cradle of his arm, makes the common people
      say, &lsquo;Well, <i>she</i> has got what she wants.&rsquo; There are not so many of
      them as people think, particularly in society. Not that the mistress of a
      great house could be thinking exclusively of her own happiness; there were
      guests going away and other guests arriving and settling in, a second
      instalment, more numerous and less intimate, the whole in fact of the
      Academic set. There were the Duke de Courson-Launay, the Prince and
      Princess de Fitz-Roy, the De Circourts, the Huchenards, Saint-Avol the
      diplomatist, Moser and his daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Henry of the American
      embassy. It was a hard task to provide entertainment and occupation for
      all these people and to fuse such different elements. No one understood
      the business better than she, but just now it was a burden and a weariness
      to her. She would have liked to keep quiet and meditate on her happiness,
      to think of nothing else: and she could devise no other amusements for her
      guests than the invariable. visit to the fish preserves, to Ronsard&rsquo;s
      castle, and to the Orphanage. Her own pleasure was complete when her hand
      touched Paul&rsquo;s, as accident brought them together in the same boat or the
      same carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of one such pompous expedition on the river, the little
      fleet from Mousseaux, sailing on a shimmering mirror of silken awnings and
      ducal pennons, had gone somewhat further than usual. Paul Astier was in
      the boat in front of his lady&rsquo;s. He was sitting in the stern beside
      Laniboire, and was receiving the Academician&rsquo;s confidences. Having been
      invited to stay at Mousseaux till his report was finished, the old fool
      fancied that he was making good progress towards the coveted succession;
      and as always happens in such cases, he chose Paul as the confidant of his
      hopes. After telling him what he had said and what she had answered, and
      one thing and another, he was just saying, &lsquo;Now, young man, what would you
      do, if you were me?&rsquo; when a clear voice of low pitch rang over the water
      from the boat behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur Astier!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Duchess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See yonder, among the reeds. It looks like Védrine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Védrine it was, painting away, with his wife and children at his side, on
      an old flat-bottomed boat moored to a willow branch alongside of a green
      islet, where the wagtails were chirping themselves hoarse. The boats drew
      quickly up beside him, any novelty being a break to the everlasting tedium
      of fashionable society: and while the Duchess greeted with her sweetest
      smile Madame Védrine, who had once been her guest at Mousseaux, the ladies
      looked with interest at the artist&rsquo;s strange home and the beautiful
      children, born of its light and its love, as they lay in the shelter of
      their green refuge on the clear, placid stream, which reflected the
      picture of their happiness. After the first greetings, Védrine, palette in
      hand, gave Paul an account of the doings at Clos Jallanges, which was
      visible through the mists of the river, half-way up the hill side&mdash;a
      long low white house with an Italian roof. &lsquo;My dear fellow, they have all
      gone crazy there! The vacancy has turned their heads. They spend their
      days ticking votes&mdash;your mother, Picheral, and the poor invalid in
      her wheelchair. She too has caught the Academic fever, and talks of moving
      to Paris, entertaining and giving parties to help her brother on.&rsquo; So
      Védrine, to escape the general madness, camped out all day and worked in
      the open air&mdash;children and all; and pointing to his old boat he said,
      with a simple unresentful laugh, &lsquo;My dahabeeah, you see; my trip to the
      Nile.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once the little boy, who in the midst of so many people, so many
      pretty ladies and pretty dresses, had eyes for no one but old Laniboire,
      addressed him in a clear voice, &lsquo;Please, are you the gentleman of the
      Académie who is going to be a hundred?&rsquo; The philosopher, occupied in
      showing off his boating for the benefit of the fair Antonia, was all but
      knocked off his seat: and when the peals of laughter had somewhat
      subsided, Védrine explained that the child was strangely interested in
      Jean Réhu, whom he did not know and had never seen, merely because he was
      nearly a hundred years old. Every day the handsome little boy asked about
      the old man and inquired how he was. Child as he was, he admired such
      length of days with something of a personal regard. If others had lived to
      a hundred, why not he?
    </p>
    <p>
      But a sudden freshening of the breeze filled the sails of the little
      craft, and fluttered all the tiny pennons; a mass of clouds was moving up
      from over Blois, and towards Mousseaux a film of rain dimmed the horizon,
      while the four lights on the top of the towers sparkled against the black
      sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of hurry and confusion. Then the vessels went away
      between the banks of yellow sand, one behind the other in the narrow
      channels; while Védrine, pleased by the brightness of the colours beneath
      the stormy sky and by the striking figures of the boatmen, standing in the
      bows and leaning hard on their long poles, turned to his wife, who was
      kneeling in the punt packing in the children, the colour-box, and the
      palette, and said, &lsquo;Look over there, mamma. I sometimes say of a friend,
      that we are in the same boat. Well, there you may see what I mean. As
      those boats fly in line through the wind, with the darkness-coming down,
      so are we men and workers, generation after generation. It&rsquo;s no use being
      shy of the fellows in your own boat; you know them, you rub up against
      them, you are friends without wishing it or even knowing it, all sailing
      on the same tack. But how the fellows in front do loiter and get in the
      way! There&rsquo;s nothing in common between their boat and ours. We are too far
      off, we cannot catch what they say. We never trouble about them except to
      call out &ldquo;Go ahead; get on, do!&rdquo; Meanwhile youth in the boat behind is
      pushing <i>us</i>; they would not mind running us down; and we shout to
      them angrily, &ldquo;Easy there! Where&rsquo;s the hurry?&rdquo; Well, as for me,&rsquo; and he
      drew himself to his full height, towering above the line of coast and
      river, &lsquo;I belong, of course, to my own beat and I am fond of it. But the
      boat just ahead and the one coming up interest me not less. I would hail
      them, signal to them, speak to them all. All of us alike, those before and
      those behind, are threatened by the same dangers, and every boat finds the
      current strong, the sky treacherous, and the evening quick to close in...
      Now, my dears, we must make haste; here comes the rain!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray for the repose of the soul of the most noble Lord, the Duke Charles
      Henri François Padovani, Prince d&rsquo;Olmitz, formerly Member of the Senate,
      Ambassador and Minister, Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, who departed
      this life September 20, 1880, at his estate of Barbicaglia, where his
      remains have been interred. A mass for the deceased will be celebrated on
      Sunday next in the private chapel, where you are invited to attend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This quaint summons was being proclaimed on both banks of the Loire,
      between Mousseaux and Onzain, by mourners hired from Vafflard&rsquo;s, wearing
      tall hats with crape mufflers that reached the ground, and ringing their
      heavy bells as they walked. Paul Astier, hearing the words as he came
      downstairs to the midday breakfast, felt his heart beat high with joy and
      pride. Four days ago the news of the Duke&rsquo;s death had startled Mousseaux
      as the report of a gun startles a covey of partridges, and had
      unexpectedly dispersed and scattered the second instalment of guests to
      various seaside and holiday resorts. The Duchess had had to set off at
      once for Corsica, leaving at the castle only a few very intimate friends.
      The melancholy sound of the voices and moving bells, carried to Paul&rsquo;s ear
      by a breeze from the river through the open panes of the staircase window,
      the antiquated and princely form of the funeral invitation, could not but
      invest the domain of Mousseaux with an impressive air of grandeur, which
      added to the height of its four towers and its immemorial trees. And as
      all this was to be his (for the Duchess on leaving had begged him to stay
      at the castle, as there were important decisions to be taken on her
      return), the proclamation of death sounded in his ears like the
      announcement of his approaching installation. &lsquo;Pray for the repose of the
      soul,&rsquo; said the voices. At last he really had fortune within his grasp,
      and this time it should not be taken from him. &lsquo;Member of the Senate,
      Ambassador and Minister,&rsquo; said the voices again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those bells are depressing, are they not, Monsieur Paul?&rsquo; said Mdlle.
      Moser who was sitting at breakfast between her father and the Academician
      Laniboire. The Duchess had kept these guests at Mousseaux, partly to amuse
      Paul&rsquo;s solitude and partly to give a little more rest and fresh air to the
      poor &lsquo;Antigone,&rsquo; kept in bondage by the interminable candidature of her
      father. There was certainly no fear that the Duchess would find a rival in
      this woman, who had eyes like a beaten hound, hair without colour, and no
      other thought but her humiliating petition for the unattainable place in
      the Académie. But on this particular morning she had taken more pains than
      usual with her appearance, and wore a bright dress open at the neck. The
      poor neck was very thin and lean, but&mdash;there was no higher game. So
      Laniboire, in high spirits, was teasing her with a gay freedom. No, he did
      not think the death-bells at all depressing, nor the repetition of &lsquo;Pray
      for the repose,&rsquo; as it died away in the distance. No, life seemed to him
      by contrast more enjoyable than usual, the <i>Vouvray</i> sparkled more
      brightly in the decanters, and his good stories had a telling echo in the
      huge half-empty dining-room. The sodden subservient face of Moser the
      candidate wore a fawning smile, though he wished his daughter away. But
      the philosopher was a man of great influence in the Académie.
    </p>
    <p>
      After coffee had been served on the terrace, Laniboire, with his face
      coloured like a Redskin, called out, &lsquo;Now let&rsquo;s go and work, Mdlle. Moser;
      I feel quite in the humour. I believe I shall finish my report to-day.&rsquo; 
      The gentle little lady, who sometimes acted as his secretary, rose with
      some regret. On a delicious day like this, hazy with the first mists of
      autumn, a good walk, or perhaps a continuation on the gallery of her talk
      with the charming and well-mannered M. Paul, would have pleased her better
      than writing at old M. Laniboire&rsquo;s dictation commendations of devoted
      hospital-nurses or exemplary attendants. But her father urged her to go,
      as the great man wanted her. She obeyed and went upstairs behind
      Laniboire, followed by old Moser, who was going to have his afternoon nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laniboire may have had Pascal&rsquo;s nose, but he had not his manners. When
      Paul came back from cooling his ambitious hopes by a long walk in the
      woods, he found the break waiting at the foot of the steps in the great
      court. The two fine horses were pawing the ground, and Mdlle. Moser was
      inside, surrounded by boxes and bags, while Moser, looking bewildered,
      stood on the doorstep, feeling in his pockets and bestowing coins on two
      or three sneering footmen. Paul went up to the carriage, &lsquo;So you are
      leaving us, Mademoiselle.&rsquo; She gave him a thin clammy hand, on which she
      had forgotten to put a glove, and without saying a word, or removing the
      handkerchief with which she was wiping her eyes under her veil, she bent
      her head in sign of good-bye. He learnt little more from old Moser, who
      stammered out in a low voice, as he stood vexed and gloomy, with one foot
      on the step of the carriage &lsquo;It&rsquo;s her doing: she <i>will</i> go. He was
      rude to her she says, but I can&rsquo;t believe it.&rsquo; Then with a profound sigh,
      and knitting the wrinkle in his brow, the deep, red, scar-like wrinkle of
      the Academic candidate, he added, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a very bad thing for my election.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Laniboire stayed all the afternoon in his room, and at dinner, as he took
      his seat opposite Paul, he said, &lsquo;Do you know why our friends the Mosers
      went off so suddenly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir, do you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very strange, very strange.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He assumed an air of great composure for the benefit of the servants, but
      it was obvious that he was disturbed, worried, and in desperate fear of a
      scandal. Gradually he regained his serenity and satisfaction, not being
      able to think ill of life at dinner, and ended by admitting to his young
      friend that he had perhaps been a little too attentive. &lsquo;But it is her
      father&rsquo;s fault; he pesters me; and even an awarder of good-conduct prizes
      has his feelings, eh?&rsquo; He lifted his glass of liqueur with a triumphant
      flourish, cut short by Paul&rsquo;s remark, &lsquo;What will the Duchess say? Of
      course Mdlle. Moser must have written to her to explain why she left.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Laniboire turned pale. &lsquo;Really, do you think she did?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul pressed the point, in the hopes of ridding himself of such a far from
      gay gallant. If the lady had not written, there was the chance that a
      servant might say something. Then, wrinkling his deceitful little nose, he
      said, &lsquo;If I were you, my dear sir&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh, pooh! Nonsense! I may get a scolding, but it won&rsquo;t really do me any
      harm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But in spite of his assumed confidence, the day before the Duchess
      returned, upon the pretext that the election to the Académie was coming
      on, and that the damp evenings were bad for his rheumatism, he went off,
      taking in his portmanteau his completed report on the prizes for
      good-conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess arrived for Sunday&rsquo;s mass, celebrated with great magnificence
      in the Renaissance chapel, where Védrine&rsquo;s versatility had restored both
      the fine stained glass and the wonderful carving of the reredos. A huge
      crowd from the villages of the neighbourhood filled the chapel to
      overflowing, and gathered in the great court. Everywhere were awkward
      fellows in hideous black coats, and long blue blouses shining from the
      iron, everywhere white caps and kerchiefs stiff with starch round sunburnt
      necks. All these people were brought together not by the religious
      ceremony, nor by the honours paid to the old Duke, who was unknown in the
      district, but by the open-air feast which was to follow the mass. The long
      tables and benches were arranged on both sides of the long lordly avenue;
      and here, after the service, between two and three thousand peasants had
      no difficulty in finding room. At first there was some constraint; the
      guests, overawed by the troop of servants in mourning and the rangers with
      crape on their caps, spoke in whispers under the shadow of the majestic
      elms. But as they warmed with the wine and the victuals, the funeral feast
      grew more lively, and ended in a vast merrymaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      To escape this unpleasant carnival, the Duchess and Paul went for a drive,
      sweeping rapidly in an open carriage draped with black along the roads and
      fields, abandoned to the desertion of Sunday. The mourning cockades of the
      tall footmen and the long veil of the widow opposite reminded the young
      man of other similar drives. He thought to himself, &lsquo;My destiny seems to
      lie in the way of dead husbands.&rsquo; He felt a touch of regret at the thought
      of Colette de Rosen&rsquo;s little curly head, contrasting so brightly with the
      black mass of her surroundings. The Duchess however, tired as she was by
      her journey, and looking stouter than usual in her improvised mourning,
      had a magnificence of manner entirely wanting in Colette, and besides, her
      dead husband did not embarrass her, for she was much too frank to feign a
      grief which ordinary women think necessary under such circumstances, even
      when the deceased has been cordially detested and completely abandoned.
      The road rang under the horses&rsquo; hoofs, as it unrolled before them,
      climbing or descending gentle slopes, bordered now by little oak
      plantations, now by huge plains which, in the neighbourhood of the
      isolated mills, were swept by circling flights of crows. A pale sunlight
      gleamed through rare gaps in a sky soft, rainy, and low: and to protect
      them from the wind as they drove, the same wrap enveloped them both, so
      that their knees were closely pressed together under the furs. The Duchess
      was talking of her native Corsica, and of a wonderful <i>vocero</i> which
      had been improvised at the funeral by her maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Matéa?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Matéa. She&rsquo;s quite a poet, fancy&rsquo;&mdash;and the Duchess quoted some
      of the lines of the <i>voceratrice</i>, in the spirited Corsican dialect,
      admirably suited to her contralto voice. But to the &lsquo;important decision&rsquo; 
      she did not refer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was the important decision that interested Paul Astier, and not the
      verses of the lady&rsquo;s-maid. No doubt it would be discussed that evening. To
      pass the time, he told her, in a low tone, how he had got rid of
      Laniboire. &lsquo;Poor little Moser,&rsquo; said the Duchess, &lsquo;her father really must
      be elected this time.&rsquo; After that they spoke but a word now and then. They
      only drew together, lulled, as it were, by the gentle movement of the
      carriage, while the daylight left the darkening fields, and let them see
      over towards the furnaces sudden flashes of flame and flickering gleams
      like lightning against the sky. Unfortunately the drive home was spoilt by
      the drunken cries and songs of the crowds returning from the feast. The
      peasants got among the wheels of the carriage like cattle, and from the
      ditches on either side of the road, into which they rolled, came snores
      and grunts, their peculiar fashion of praying for the repose of the soul
      of the most noble Lord Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked, as usual, on the gallery, and the Duchess, leaning against
      Paul&rsquo;s shoulder to look out at the darkness between the massive pillars
      which cut the dim line of the horizon, murmured, &lsquo;This is happiness!
      Together, and alone!&rsquo; Still not a word on the subject which Paul was
      waiting for. He tried to bring her to it, and with his lips in her hair
      asked what she was going to do in the winter. Should she go back to Paris?
      Oh, no! certainly not. She was sick of Paris and its false society, its
      disguises and its treachery! She was still undecided, however, whether to
      shut herself up at Mousseaux, or to set out on a long journey to Syria and
      Palestine. What did he think? Why, this must be the important decision
      they were to consider! It had been a mere pretext to keep him there! She
      had been afraid that if he went back to Paris, and away from her, some one
      else would carry him off! Paul, thinking that he had been taken in, bit
      his lips as he said to himself, &lsquo;Oh, if that&rsquo;s your game, my lady, we&rsquo;ll
      see!&rsquo; Tired by her journey and a long day in the open air, the Duchess bid
      him good-night and went wearily up to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day they hardly met. The Duchess was busy settling accounts with
      her steward and her tenants, much to the admiration of Maître Gobineau,
      the notary, who observed to Paul as they sat at breakfast, with slyness
      marked in every wrinkle of his shrivelled old face, &lsquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s not easy to
      get on the blind side of the Duchess!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Little he knows,&rsquo; was the thought of the Duchess&rsquo;s young pursuer as he
      played with his light brown beard. But when he heard the hard cold tones
      which his lady&rsquo;s tender contralto could assume in a business discussion,
      he felt that he would have to play his cards carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast there arrived some trunks from Paris with Spricht&rsquo;s
      forewoman and two fitters. And at last, about four o&rsquo;clock, the Duchess
      appeared in a marvellous costume, which made her look quite young and
      slim, and proposed a walk in the park. They went along briskly, side by
      side, keeping to the bye-paths to avoid the noise of the heavy rakes.
      Three times a day the gardeners struggled against the accumulation of the
      falling leaves. But in vain; in an hour the walks were again covered by
      the same Oriental carpet, richly coloured with purple, green, and bronze;
      and their feet rustled in it as they walked under the soft level rays of
      the sun. The Duchess spoke of the husband who had brought so much sorrow
      into her youth; she was anxious to make Paul feel that her mourning was
      entirely conventional and did not affect her feelings. Paul understood her
      object, and smiled coldly, determined to carry out his plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the lower end of the park they sat down, near a little building hidden
      behind maples and privet, where the fishing nets and oars of the boats
      were kept. From their seat they looked across the sloping lawns and the
      plantations and shrubberies showing patches of gold. The castle, seen in
      the background, with its long array of closed windows and deserted
      terraces, lifting its towers and turrets proudly to the sky, seemed
      withdrawn, as it were, into the past, and grander than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry to leave all that,&rsquo; said Paul, with a sigh. She looked at him
      in amazement with storm in her knitted brows. Go away? Did he mean to go
      away? Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No help. Such is life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are we to part? And what is to become of me?&mdash;and the journey we
      were to make together?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not interrupt you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; he said. But how could a poor
      artist like him afford himself a journey to Palestine? It was an
      impossible dream, like Védrine&rsquo;s dahabeeah ending in a punt on the Loire.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her aristocratic shoulders, and said, &lsquo;Why, Paul, what
      nonsense! You know that all I have is yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mine? By what right?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was out! But she did not see yet what he was driving at. Fearing that
      he had gone too far, he added, &lsquo;I mean, what right, in the prejudiced view
      of society, shall I have to travel with you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well then, we will stay at Mousseaux.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He made her a little mocking bow as he said, &lsquo;Your architect has finished
      his work on the castle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, we will find him something to do, if I have to set fire to it
      to-night!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed her open-hearted tender laugh, leant against him, and taking
      his hands pressed them against her cheeks&mdash;fond trifling this, not
      the word which he was waiting for, and trying to make her say. Then he
      burst out, &lsquo;If you love me, Antonia, let me go. I must make a living for
      myself and mine. Society would not forgive my living on the bounty of a
      woman who is not and never will be my wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood, and closed her eyes as if on the brink of an abyss. In the
      long silence that followed was heard all over the park the falling of the
      leaves in the breeze, some still heavy with sap, dropping in bunches from
      bough to bough, others stealing down with a scarcely audible sound, like
      the rustling of a dress. Round the little hut, under the maples, it was
      more like the pattering footsteps of some voiceless crowd which moved
      around. She rose with a shiver. &lsquo;It is cold; let us go in.&rsquo; She had made
      her sacrifice. It would kill her, very probably, but the world should not
      see the degradation of the Duchess Padovani into Madame Paul Astier, who
      had married her architect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul spent the evening in making the obvious arrangements for his
      departure. He gave orders about his luggage, bestowed princely gratuities
      upon the servants, and inquired about the time of the trains, chatting
      away without constraint, but quite unsuccessful in breaking through the
      gloomy silence of the fair Antonia, who read with absorbed attention a
      magazine, of which she did not turn the pages. But when he took his leave
      of her and thanked her for her prolonged and gracious hospitality, in the
      light of the huge lace lamp-shade he saw on her haughty face a look of
      anguish, and in her eyes, magnificent as those of a dying lion, a
      beseeching supplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached his room the young man looked to see that the door to the
      smoking-room was bolted; then he put out his light and waited, sitting
      quite still on the divan close to the communication. If she did not come,
      he had made a mistake and must begin again. But there was a slight noise
      in the private passage, the sound of a gown, then after a momentary
      surprise at not being able to come straight in, a touch with the tip of a
      finger, scarcely a knock. He did not move, and paid no attention to a
      little significant coughing. Then he heard her go away, with an agitated,
      uneven step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; thought he, &lsquo;she is mine. I can do what I like with her.&rsquo; And he
      went quietly to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I were called the Prince d&rsquo;Athis, would you not have married me when
      your mourning was over? Yet D&rsquo;Athis did not love you, and Paul Astier
      does. Proud of his love, he would gladly have proclaimed it abroad instead
      of hiding it as a thing to be ashamed of. Ah, Mari&rsquo; Anto! I have awaked
      from a beautiful dream! Farewell for ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She read his letter with her eyes hardly open, swollen with the tears she
      had been shedding all night. &lsquo;Is Monsieur Astier gone?&rsquo; The maid who was
      leaning out of the window to fasten back the shutters that moment caught
      sight of the carriage that was taking away M. Paul, right at the end of
      the avenue, too far off to be called back. The Duchess sprang out of bed
      and flew to the clock. &lsquo;Nine o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; The express did not reach Onzain
      till ten. &lsquo;Quick, a messenger&mdash;Bertoli, and the best of the horses!&rsquo; 
      By taking the short cut through the woods he could reach the station
      before the carriage. Whilst her orders were being hastily carried out she
      wrote a note, standing, without waiting to dress. &lsquo;Come back; all shall be
      as you wish.&rsquo; No, that was too cold. That would not bring him back. She
      tore up the note, wrote another, &lsquo;What you will, so long as I am yours,&rsquo; 
      and signed it with her title. Then, wild at the thought that perhaps even
      that would not bring him, she cried, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go myself! My habit, quick!&rsquo; 
      And she called out of the window to Bertoli, whose horse was by this time
      waiting impatiently at the foot of the steps, and gave orders to saddle
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle Oger&rsquo; for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not ridden for five years. Her figure had grown stouter, the
      stitches of the habit gave way, some of the hooks were missing. &lsquo;Never
      mind, Matéa, never mind.&rsquo; She went down the staircase with the train over
      her arm, between the footmen who stood with blank looks of astonishment,
      and set off full speed down the avenue, through the gate, into the road,
      into the wood, and down the cool green paths and long avenues, where the
      wild creatures fluttered and leapt away as she galloped madly by. She must
      and will have him. He is her death and life. She has tasted love; and what
      else does the world contain? Leaning forward, she listens for the sound of
      the train and watches in every distant view for the steam skirting the
      horizon. If only she is in time! Poor thing! She might let her horse walk,
      and yet she would overtake that handsome runaway He is her evil genius,
      and he is not to be escaped.

      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
            From the Vicomte de Freydet

                   To Mademoiselle Germaine de Freydet Villa Beauséjour,

                              Paris-Passy.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Café d&rsquo;Orsay: 11 A.M. at breakfast.</i> EVERY two hours, and oftener if
      I can, I shall send you off an interim despatch like this, as much to
      relieve your anxiety, dearest, as for the pleasure of being with you
      throughout this great day, which I hope will end with the news of victory,
      in spite of defections at the last moment. Picheral told me just now of a
      saying of Laniboire&rsquo;s, &lsquo;When a man enters the Académie he wears a sword,
      but he does not draw it.&rsquo; an allusion, of course, to the Astier duel. It
      was not I who fought, but the creature cares more for his jest than for
      his promise. Cannot count on Danjou, either. After having said so often to
      me, &lsquo;You must join us,&rsquo; this morning in the secretary&rsquo;s office he came up
      to me and whispered, &lsquo;You should let us miss you,&rsquo; perhaps the best
      epigram on his list. Never mind, I&rsquo;m well ahead. My rivals are not
      formidable Fancy Baron Huchenard, the author of &lsquo;Cave Man,&rsquo; in the
      Académie Française! Why, Paris would rise! As for M. Dalzon, I can&rsquo;t think
      how he has the face. I have got a copy of his too notorious book. I do not
      like to use it, but he had better be careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>2 P.M.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Institute, in my good master&rsquo;s rooms, where I shall await the
      result of the voting. Perhaps it is pure imagination, but I fancy that my
      arrival, though they expected me, has put them out here a little. Our
      friends were finishing breakfast. There was a bustle and banging of doors,
      and Corentine, instead of showing me into the drawing-room, hustled me
      into the library, where my old master joined me with an embarrassed air,
      and in a low voice advised me to keep extremely quiet. He was quite
      depressed. I asked if he had any bad news. He said first, &lsquo;No, no, my dear
      boy,&rsquo; and then, grasping my hand, &lsquo;Come, cheer up.&rsquo; For some time past the
      poor man has been much altered. He is evidently ready to overflow with
      vexation and sorrow that he will not express. Probably some deep private
      trouble, quite unconnected with my candidature; but I am so nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than an hour to wait. I am amusing myself by looking across the court
      through the great bay window of the meeting-room at the long rows of
      busts. The Academicians! Is it an omen?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>2.45 P.M.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just seen all my judges go by, thirty-seven of them, if I counted
      right. The full number of the Académie, since Epinchard is at Nice,
      Ripault-Babin in bed, and Loisillon in the grave. It was glorious to see
      all the distinguished men come into the court; the younger walking slowly
      with serious looks and head bent as if under the weight of a
      responsibility too heavy for them, the old men carrying themselves well
      and stepping out briskly. A few gouty and rheumatic, like Courson-Launay,
      drove up to the foot of the steps and leant on the arm of a colleague.
      They stood about before going up, talking in little knots, and I watched
      the movements of their backs and shoulders and the play of their open
      hands. What would I not give to hear the last discussion of my prospects!
      I opened the window gently, but just then a carriage covered with luggage
      came clattering into the court, and out got a traveller wrapped in furs
      and wearing an otter-skin cap. It was Epinchard; just think, dear,
      Epinchard arriving from Nice on purpose to vote for me. Good fellow! Then
      my old master went by, his broad-brimmed hat down over his <i>eyes</i>; he
      was turning over the copy of &lsquo;Without the Veil,&rsquo; which I gave him, to be
      used if necessary. Well, self-defence is always legitimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there&rsquo;s nothing to see but two carriages waiting and the bust of
      Minerva keeping guard. Goddess, protect me! They must be beginning the
      calling of names, and the interrogatory. Each Academician has to state to
      the President that his vote is not promised. It&rsquo;s a mere formality, as you
      may suppose, and they all reply by a smile of denial or a little shake of
      the head like a Chinese mandarin.
    </p>
    <p>
      A most amazing thing has just happened! I had given my letter to Corentine
      and was getting a breath of fresh air at the window and trying to read the
      secret of my fate in the gloomy front of the building opposite, when at
      the next window to mine I caught sight of Huchenard, airing himself too,
      quite close to me. Huchenard, my rival&mdash;Astier-Réhu&rsquo;s worst enemy,
      installed in his study! We were, both equally amazed, bowed, and withdrew
      at the same moment. But there he is, I can hear him, I feel that he is on
      the other side of the partition. No doubt, like me, he is waiting to hear
      the decision of the Académie, only he has all the space of &lsquo;Villemain&rsquo;s
      reception-room,&rsquo; while I am suffocating in this hole crammed full of
      papers! Now I understand the confusion caused by my arrival. But what is
      it all about? What is going on? My dear Germaine, my head is going! Which
      of us is the fool?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lost! And by treachery, by some mean Academic intrigue which I do not yet
      understand!
    </p>

    <p>
      It is clear that between the second and third taking of votes the copy of
      &lsquo;Without the Veil&rsquo; must have been sent round in the interest of Baron
      Huchenard. An explanation I must and will have. I won&rsquo;t leave the place
      till I get it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>4 P.M.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dearest sister, you may guess my feelings when, after I had heard in the
      next room M. and Madame Astier, old Réhu, and a stream of visitors
      congratulating the author of &lsquo;Cave Man,&rsquo; the door of the library opened
      and my old master came in, reaching out his hands and saying, &lsquo;My dear
      boy, forgive me&rsquo;&mdash;between heat and emotion he was nearly speechless&mdash;&lsquo;forgive
      me, that man had a hold over me. I had to do it, I had to do it. I thought
      I could avert the disaster which threatens me, but destiny is not to be
      escaped, no, not even by a base act&mdash;&rsquo; He held out his arms and I
      embraced him without the least anger, without indeed quite understanding
      the mystery of this bitter grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, my own loss is easily retrieved. I have first-rate news of
      Ripault-Babin. He can hardly live through the week. One more campaign,
      dear, one more. Unfortunately the Hôtel Padovani will be closed all the
      winter, owing to the Duchess&rsquo;s deep mourning. So for our scene of
      operations we shall have the &lsquo;at home&rsquo; days of Madame Astier, Madame
      Ancelin, and Madame Eviza, of whose fashion there is no question since the
      visit of the Grand Duke. But the first thing, dear Germaine, will be to
      move. Passy is too far off; the Académie will not go there. You will say I
      am dragging you about again, but it is so important. Just look at
      Huchenard. He had no claim whatever but his parties. I dine with my dear
      master; don&rsquo;t wait for me.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 Your affectionate brother,

                             Abel de Freydet.

    <p>
      Moser&rsquo;s solitary vote in each counting was given by Laniboire, the man who
      reports for the good conduct prizes. They tell a queer story about it
      There are strange things under the dome!

      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a scandal.&rsquo; 
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There must be a reply. The Académie cannot be silent under the attack.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you thinking of? On the contrary, the dignity of the Académie
      demands&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen, gentlemen, the real feeling of the Académie is&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In their private assembly room, in front of the great chimney-piece and
      the full-length portrait of Cardinal Richelieu, the &lsquo;deities&rsquo; were engaged
      in a discussion preliminary to the meeting. The cold smoke-stained light
      of a Parisian winter&rsquo;s day, falling through the great lantern overhead,
      gave effect to the chill solemnity of the marble busts ranged in row along
      the walls; and the huge fire in the chimney, nearly as red as the
      Cardinal&rsquo;s robe, was not enough to warm the little council-chamber or
      court-house, furnished with green leather seats, long horse-shoe table in
      front of the desk, and chain-bedecked usher, keeping the entrance near the
      place of Picheral, the Secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally the best part of the meeting is the quarter of an hour&rsquo;s grace
      allowed to late-comers. The Academicians gather in groups with their backs
      to the fire and their coat tails turned up, chatting familiarly in
      undertones. But on this afternoon the conversation was general and had
      risen to the utmost violence of public debate, each new comer joining in
      from the far end of the room, while he signed the attendance list. Some
      even before entering, while they were still depositing their great coats,
      comforters, and overshoes in the empty room of the Académie des Sciences,
      opened the door to join in the cries of &lsquo;Shame!&rsquo; and &lsquo;Scandalous!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The cause of all the commotion was this. There had appeared in a morning
      paper a reprint of a highly disrespectful report made to the Académie of
      Florence upon Astier-Réhu&rsquo;s &lsquo;Galileo&rsquo; and the manifestly apocryphal and
      absurd (sic) historical documents which were published with it. The report
      had been sent with the greatest privacy to the President of the Académie
      Française, and for some days there had been considerable excitement at the
      Institute, where Astier-Réhu&rsquo;s decision was eagerly awaited. He had said
      nothing but, &lsquo;I know, I know; I am taking the necessary steps.&rsquo; And now
      suddenly here was this report which they believed to be known only to
      themselves, hurled at them like a bomb-shell from the outer sheet of one
      of the most widely circulated of the Parisian newspapers, and accompanied
      by remarks insulting to the Permanent Secretary and to the whole Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furious was the indignant outcry against the impudence of the journalist
      and the folly of Astier-Réhu, which had brought this upon them. The
      Académie has not been accustomed to such attacks, since it has prudently
      opened its doors to &lsquo;gentlemen of the Press.&rsquo; The fiery Laniboire,
      familiar with every kind of &lsquo;sport.&rsquo; talked of cutting off the gentleman&rsquo;s
      ears, and it took two or three colleagues to restrain his ardour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, Laniboire; we wear the sword, but we do not draw it Why, it&rsquo;s your
      own epigram, confound you, though adopted by the Institute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen, you remember that Pliny the Elder, in the thirteenth book of
      his &ldquo;Natural History&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;here arrived Gazan, who came in puffing with
      his elephantine trot&mdash;&lsquo;is one of the first writers who mentions
      counterfeit autographs; amongst others, a false letter of Priam&rsquo;s on
      papyrus&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur Gazan has not signed the list,&rsquo; cried Picheral&rsquo;s sharp falsetto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I beg your pardon.&rsquo; And the fat man went off to sign, still
      discoursing about papyrus and King Priam, though unheard for the hubbub of
      angry voices, in which the only word that could be distinguished was
      &lsquo;Académie.&rsquo; They all talked about the Académie as if it were an actual
      live person, whose real view each man believed himself alone to know and
      to express. Suddenly the exclamations ceased, as Astier-Réhu entered,
      signed his name, and quietly deposited at his place as Permanent Secretary
      the ensign of his office, carried under his arm. Then moving towards his
      colleagues he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen, I have bad news for you. I sent to the Library to be tested
      the twelve or fifteen thousand documents which made what I called my
      collection. Well, gentlemen, all are forgeries. The Académie of Florence
      stated the truth. I am the victim of a stupendous hoax.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he wiped from his brow the great drops of sweat wrung out by the strain
      of his confession, some one asked in an insolent tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and <i>so</i>, Mr. Secretary&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So, M. Danjou, I had no other choice but to bring an action&mdash;which
      is what I have done. There was a general protest, all declaring that a
      lawsuit was out of the question and would bring ridicule upon the whole
      Society, to which he answered that he was exceedingly sorry to disoblige
      his colleagues, but his mind was made up. &lsquo;Besides, the man is in prison
      and the proceedings have commenced.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had the private assembly-room heard a roar like that which greeted
      this statement. Laniboire distinguished himself as usual among the most
      excited by shouting that the Académie ought to get rid of so dangerous a
      member. In the first heat of their anger some of the assembly began to
      discuss the question aloud. Could it be done? Could the Académie say to a
      member who had brought the whole body into an undignified position, &lsquo;Go! I
      reverse my judgment. Deity as you are, I relegate you to the rank of a
      mere mortal&rsquo;? Suddenly, either having caught a few words of the
      discussion, or by one of those strange intuitions which seem occasionally
      to come as an inspiration to the most hopelessly deaf, old Réhu, who had
      been keeping to himself, away from the fire for fear of a fit, remarked in
      his loud unmodulated voice, &lsquo;During the Restoration, for reasons merely
      political, we turned out eleven members at once.&rsquo; The patriarch gave the
      usual little attesting movement of the head, calling to witness his
      contemporaries of the period, white busts with vacant eyes standing in
      rows on pedestals round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eleven! whew!&rsquo; muttered Danjou amid a great silence. And Laniboire,
      cynical as before, said &lsquo;All societies are cowardly; it&rsquo;s the natural law
      of self-preservation.&rsquo; Here Epinchard, who had been busy near the door
      with Picheral the Secretary, rejoined the rest, and observed in a weak
      voice, between two fits of coughing, that the Permanent Secretary was not
      the only person to blame in the matter, as would appear from the minutes
      of the proceedings of July 8, 1879, which should now be read. Picheral
      from his place, in his thin brisk voice, began at a great pace: <i>On July
      8, 1879, Léonard-Pierre-Alexandre Astier-Réhu presented to the Académie
      Française a letter from Rotrou to Cardinal Richelieu respecting the
      statutes of the Society. The Académie, after an examination of this
      unpublished and interesting document, passed a vote of thanks to the
      donor, and decided to enter the letter of Rotrou upon the minutes. The
      letter is appended</i> (at this point the Secretary slackened his delivery
      and put a malicious stress upon each word) <i>with all the errors of the
      original text, which, being such as occur in ordinary correspondence,
      confirm the authenticity of the document</i>. All stood motionless in the
      faded light that came through the glass, avoiding each other&rsquo;s eyes and
      listening in utter amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I read the letter too?&rsquo; asked Picheral with a smile. He was much
      amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, read the letter too,&rsquo; said Epinchard. But after a phrase or two
      there were cries of &lsquo;Enough, enough, that will do!&rsquo; They were ashamed of
      such a letter of Rotrou. It was a crying forgery, a mere schoolboy&rsquo;s
      imitation, the sentences misshapen, and half the words not known at the
      supposed date. How could they have been so blind?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see, gentlemen, that we could scarcely throw the whole burden upon
      our unfortunate colleague,&rsquo; said Epinchard; and turning to the Permanent
      Secretary begged him to abandon proceedings which could bring nothing but
      discredit upon the whole Society and the great Cardinal himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither the fervour of the appeal nor the magnificence of the orator&rsquo;s
      attitude, as he pointed to the insignia of the Sacred Founder, could
      prevail over the stubborn resolution of Astier-Réhu. Standing firm and
      upright before the little table in the middle of the room, which was used
      as a desk for the reading of communications, with his fists clenched, as
      if he feared that his decision might be wrung out of his hands, he
      repeated that &lsquo;Nothing, I assure you, nothing&rsquo; would alter his
      determination. He struck the hard wood angrily with his big knuckles, as
      he said, &lsquo;Ah, gentlemen, I have waited, for reasons like these, too long
      already! I tell you, my &ldquo;Galileo&rdquo; is a bone in my throat! I am not rich
      enough to buy it up, and I see it in the shop windows, advertising me as
      the accomplice of a forger.&rsquo; What was his object! Why, to tear out the
      rotten pages with his own hand and burn them before all the world! A trial
      would give him the opportunity. &lsquo;You talk of ridicule? The Académie is
      above the fear of it; and as for me, a butt and a beggar as I must be, I
      shall have the proud satisfaction of having protected my personal honour
      and the dignity of history. I ask no more.&rsquo; Honest Crocodilus! In the beat
      of his rhetoric was a sound of pure probity, which rang strangely where
      all around was padded with compromise and concealment. Suddenly the usher
      announced, &lsquo;Four o&rsquo;clock, gentlemen.&rsquo; Four o&rsquo;clock! and they had not
      finished the arrangements for Ripault-Babin&rsquo;s funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, we must remember Ripault-Babin!&rsquo; observed Danjou in a mocking voice.
      &lsquo;He has died at the right moment!&rsquo; said Laniboire with mournful emphasis.
      But the point of his epigram was lost, for the usher was crying, &lsquo;Take
      your places&rsquo;; and the President was ringing his bell On his right was
      Desminières the Chancellor, and on his left the Permanent Secretary,
      reading quietly with recovered self-possession the report of the Funeral
      Committee, to an accompaniment of eager whispers and the pattering of
      sleet on the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How late you went on to-day!&rsquo; remarked Coren-tine, as she opened the door
      to her master. Corentine was certainly to be reckoned with those who had
      no great opinion of the Institute. &lsquo;M. Paul is in your study with Madame.
      You must go through the library; the drawing-room is full of people
      waiting to see you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The library, where nothing was left but the frame of the pigeon-holes,
      looked as if there had been a fire or a burglary. It depressed him, and he
      generally avoided it But to-day he went through it proudly, supported by
      the remembrance of his resolve, and of how he had declared it at the
      meeting. After an effort, which had cost him so much courage and
      determination, he felt a sweet sense of relief in the thought that his son
      was waiting for him. He had not seen him since just after the duel, when
      he had been overcome by the sight of his gallant boy, laid at full length
      and whiter than the sheet. He was thinking with delight how he would go up
      to him with open arms, and embrace him, and hold him tight, a long while,
      and say nothing&mdash;nothing! But as soon as he came into the room and
      saw the mother and son close together, whispering, with their eyes on the
      carpet, and their everlasting air of conspiracy, the affectionate impulse
      was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here you are at last!&rsquo; cried Madame Astier, who was dressed to go out.
      And in a tone of mock solemnity, as if introducing the two, she said, &lsquo;My
      dear&mdash;the Count Paul Astier.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At your service, Master,&rsquo; said Paul, as he bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astier-Réhu knitted his thick brows as he looked at them. &lsquo;<i>Count</i>
      Paul Astier?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow, as charming as ever, in spite of the tanning of six
      months spent in the open air, said he had just indulged in the
      extravagance of a Roman title, not so much for his own sake as in honour
      of the lady who was about to take his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you are going to be married,&rsquo; said his father, whose suspicions
      increased. &lsquo;And who is the lady?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Duchess Padovani.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must have lost your senses! Why she is five-and-twenty years older
      than you, and besides&mdash;and besides&mdash;&rsquo; He hesitated, trying to
      find a respectful phrase, but at last blurted right out, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t marry
      a woman who to every one&rsquo;s knowledge has belonged to another for years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A fact, however, which has never prevented our dining with her regularly,
      and accepting from her all kinds of favours,&rsquo; hissed Madame Astier,
      rearing her little head as to strike. Without bestowing on her a word or a
      look, as holding her no judge in a question of honour, the man went up to
      his son, and said in earnest tones, the muscles of his big cheeks
      twitching with emotion, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, Paul. For the sake of the name you
      bear, don&rsquo;t do it, my boy, I beg you.&rsquo; He grasped his son&rsquo;s shoulder and
      shook him, voice and hand quivering together. But the young fellow moved
      away, not liking such demonstrations, and objected generally that &lsquo;he
      didn&rsquo;t see it; it was not his view.&rsquo; The father felt the impassable
      distance between himself and his son, saw the impenetrable face and the
      look askance, and instinctively lifted up his voice in appeal to his
      rights as head of the family. A smile which he caught passing between Paul
      and his mother, a fresh proof of their joint share in this discreditable
      business, completed his exasperation. He shouted and raved, threatening to
      make a public protest, to write to the papers, to brand them both, mother
      and son, &lsquo;in his history.&rsquo; This last was his most appalling threat. When
      he had said of some historical character, &lsquo;I have branded him in my
      history,&rsquo; he thought no punishment could be more severe. Madame Astier,
      almost as familiar with the threat of branding as with the dragging of his
      trunk about the passage, contented herself with saying as she buttoned her
      gloves: &lsquo;You know every word can be heard in the next room.&rsquo; In spite of
      the curtains over the door, the murmur of conversation was audible from
      the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, repressing and swallowing his wrath, &lsquo;Listen to me, Paul,&rsquo; said
      Léonard Astier, shaking his forefinger in the young man&rsquo;s face, &lsquo;if ever
      this thing you are talking of comes to pass, do not expect to look upon me
      again. I will not be present on your wedding day; I will not have you near
      me, not even at my death-bed; You are no longer a son of mine; and you go
      with my curse upon you.&rsquo; Moving away instinctively from the finger which
      almost touched him, Paul replied with great calmness, &lsquo;Oh, you know, my
      dear father, that sort of thing is never done now-a-days! Even on the
      stage they have given up blessing and cursing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But not punishing, you scoundrel!&rsquo; growled the old man, lifting his hand.
      There was an angry cry of &lsquo;Léonard!&rsquo; from the mother, as with the prompt
      parry of a boxer Paul turned the blow aside, quietly as if he had been in
      Keyser&rsquo;s gymnasium, and without letting go the wrist he had twisted under,
      said beneath his breath, &lsquo;No, no; I won&rsquo;t have that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The tough old hillsman struggled violently, but, vigorous as he still was,
      he had found his master. At this terrible moment, while father and son
      stood face to face, breathing hate at one another, and exchanging
      murderous glances, the door of the drawing-room opened a little and showed
      the good-natured doll-like smile of a fat lady bedecked with feathers and
      flowers. &lsquo;Excuse me, dear master, I want just to say a word&mdash;why,
      Adelaide is here, and M. Paul too. Charming! delightful! Quite a family
      group!&rsquo; Madame Ancelin was right. A family group it was, a picture of the
      modern family, spoilt by the crack which runs through European society
      from top to bottom, endangering its essential principles of authority and
      subordination, and nowhere more remarkable than here, under the stately
      dome of the Institute, where the traditional domestic virtues are judged
      and rewarded.

      It was stifling in the Eighth Chamber, where the Fage case was just coming
      on after interminable preliminaries and great efforts on the part of
      influential persons to stop the proceedings. Never had this court-room,
      whose walls of a mouldy blue and diamond pattern in faded gilding reeked
      with the effluvium of rags and misery, never had this court seen squeezed
      on its dirty seats and packed in its passages such a press and such a
      crowd of fashionable and distinguished persons, so many flower-trimmed
      bonnets and spring costumes by the masters of millinery art, to throw into
      relief the dead black of the gowns and caps. People were still coming in
      through the entrance lobby, where the double doors were perpetually
      swinging as the tide flowed on, a wavy sea of thronging faces upturned
      beneath the whitish light of the landing. Everyone was there, all the
      well-known, well-worn, depressingly familiar personages that figure at
      every Parisian festivity, fashionable funeral, or famous &lsquo;first night.&rsquo; 
      There was Marguerite Oger well to the fore, and the little Countess Foder,
      and beautiful Mrs. Henry of the American Embassy. There were the ladies
      belonging to the Academic confraternity, Madame Ancein in mauve on the arm
      of Raverand, the leader of the bar; Madame Eviza, a bush of little roses
      surrounded by a busy humming swarm of would-be barristers. Behind the
      President&rsquo;s bench was Danjou, standing with folded arms, and showing above
      the audience and the judges the hard angles of his regular stage-weathered
      countenance, everywhere to be seen during the last forty years as the type
      of social commonplace in all its manifold manifestations. With the
      exception of Astier-Réhu and Baron Huchenard, who were summoned as
      witnesses, he was the only Academician bold enough to face the irreverent
      remarks that might be expected in the speech of Fage&rsquo;s counsel, Margery,
      the dreaded wit, who convulses the whole assembly and the bench with the
      mere sound of his nasal &lsquo;Well.&rsquo; Some fun was to be expected; the whole
      atmosphere of the place announced it, the erratic tilt of the barristers&rsquo; 
      caps, the gleam in the eyes and curl in the corners of the mouths of
      people giving one another little anticipatory smiles. There were endless
      anecdotes current about the achievements in gallantry of the little
      humpback who had just been brought to the prisoner&rsquo;s box and, lifting his
      long well-greased head, cast into the court over the bar the conquering
      glance of a manifest ladies&rsquo; man. Stories were told of compromising
      letters, of an account drawn up by the prisoner mentioning right out the
      names of two or three well-known ladies of fashion, the regular names
      dragged again and again into every unsavoury case. There was a copy of the
      production going the rounds of the seats reserved for the press, a simple
      conceited autobiography containing none of the revelations imputed to it
      by public rumour. Fage had beguiled the tedium of confinement by writing
      for the court the story of his life. He was born, he said, near Vassy
      (Haute Marne), as straight as anybody&mdash;so they all say&mdash;but a
      fall from a horse at fifteen had bent and inflected his spine. His taste
      for gallantry had developed somewhat late in life when he was working at a
      bookseller&rsquo;s in the Passage des Panoramas. As his deformity interfered
      with his success, he tried to find some way of getting plenty of money.
      The story of his love affairs alternating with that of his forgeries and
      the means employed, with descriptions of ink and of parchment, resulted in
      such headings to his chapters as &lsquo;My first victim&mdash;For a red ribbon&mdash;The
      gingerbread fair&mdash;I make the acquaintance of Astier-Réhu&mdash;The
      mysterious ink&mdash;I defy the chemists of the Institute.&rsquo; This brief
      epitome is enough to show the combination, the humpback&rsquo;s
      self-satisfaction <i>plus</i> the arrogance of the self-taught artisan.
      The general result of reading the production was utter amazement that the
      Permanent Secretary of the Académie Française and the official
      representatives of science and literature could have been taken in for two
      or three years by an ignorant dwarf with a brain crammed full of the
      refuse of libraries and the ill-digested parings of books. This
      constituted the extraordinary joke of the whole business, and was the
      explanation of the crowded court. People came to see the Académie
      pilloried in the person of Astier-Réhu, who sat among the witnesses, the
      mark of every eye. There he sat without moving, absorbed in his thoughts,
      not turning his head, and hardly answering the fulsome compliments of
      Freydet who was standing behind, with black gloves and a deep crape
      hat-band, having quite recently lost his sister. He had been summoned for
      the defence, and the Academic candidate was afraid that the fact might
      damage him in the eyes of his old master. He was apologising and
      explaining how he had come across the wretched Fage in Védrine&rsquo;s studio,
      and that was the reason of this unexpected call. But his whispers were
      lost in the noise of the court and the monotonous hum from the bench, as
      cases were called on and disposed of, the invariable &lsquo;This day week, this
      day week&rsquo; descending like the stroke of the guillotine and cutting short
      the barrister&rsquo;s protest, and the entreaties of poor red-faced fellows
      mopping their brows before the seat of justice. &lsquo;But, Monsieur le
      Président...&rsquo; &lsquo;This day week.&rsquo; Sometimes from the back of the court would
      come a cry and a despairing movement of a pair of arms, &lsquo;I am here, M. le
      Président, but I can&rsquo;t get through, there&rsquo;s such a crowd...&rsquo; &lsquo;This day
      week.&rsquo; When a man has beheld such clearances as these, and seen the
      symbolic scales operate with such dexterity, he gets a vivid impression of
      French justice; it is not unlike the sensation of hearing the funeral
      service raced through in a hurry by a strange priest over a pauper&rsquo;s
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the President called for the Fage case. Complete silence
      followed in the court, and even on the staircase landing where people had
      climbed on to benches to see. Then after a short consultation on the bench
      the witnesses filed out through a dense crowd of gowns on their way to the
      little room reserved for them, a dreary empty place, badly lighted by
      glass windows that had once been red, and looking out on a narrow alley.
      Astier-Réhu, who was to be called first, did not go in, but walked up and
      down in the gloomy passage between the witness-room and the court. Freydet
      wished to stay with him, but he said in a colourless voice, &lsquo;No, no, let
      me alone, I want to be alone.&rsquo; So the candidate joined the other witnesses
      who were standing in little knots&mdash;Baron Huchenard, Bos the
      palaeographer, Delpech the chemist, of the Académie des Sciences, some
      experts in handwriting, and two or three pretty girls, the originals of
      some of the photographs that adorned the walls of Fage&rsquo;s room, delighted
      at the notoriety that the proceedings would bring them, laughing loudly
      and displaying startling little spring hats strangely different from the
      linen cap and woollen mittens of the caretaker at the Cour des Comptes.
      Védrine also had been summoned, and Freydet came and sat by him on the
      wide ledge of the open window. The two friends, whirled apart in the
      opposing currents that divide men&rsquo;s lives in Paris, had not met since the
      summer before until the recent funeral of poor Germaine de Freydet Védrine
      pressed his friend&rsquo;s hand and asked how he was, how he felt after so
      terrible a blow. Freydet shrugged his shoulders, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s hard, very hard,
      but after all I&rsquo;m used to it.&rsquo; Then, as Védrine stared in wonder at his
      selfish stoicism, he added, &lsquo;Just think, that&rsquo;s twice in one year that I
      have been fooled.&rsquo; The blow, the only blow, that he remembered, was his
      failure to get Ripault-Babin&rsquo;s seat, which he had lately missed, as he had
      missed Loisillon&rsquo;s before. Presently he understood, sighed deeply, and
      said, &lsquo;Ah, yes, poor Germaine!&rsquo; She had taken so much trouble all the
      winter about his unlucky candidature. Two dinners a week! Up to twelve or
      one o&rsquo;clock she would be wheeling her chair all over the drawing-room. She
      had sacrificed her remaining strength to it, and was even more excited and
      keen than her brother. And at the last, the very last, when she was past
      speaking, her poor twisted fingers went on counting upon the hem of the
      sheet &lsquo;Yes, Védrine, she died, ticking and calculating my chances of
      Ripault-Babin&rsquo;s seat. Oh, if only for her sake, I will get into their
      Académie, in defiance of them all, and in honour of her dear memory!&rsquo; He
      stopped short, then in an altered and lower voice went on: &lsquo;Really I don&rsquo;t
      know why I talk like that. The truth is that, since they put the idea into
      my head, I can think of nothing else. My sister is dead and I have hardly
      given her a tear. I had to pay my calls and &ldquo;beg for the Académie,&rdquo; as
      that fellow says. The thing takes the very life out of me. It&rsquo;s perfectly
      maddening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the savage plainness of these words and the excited ring of the angry
      voice, the sculptor could scarcely recognise his gentle courteous friend,
      to whom mere living used to be a joy. The absent expression in his eye,
      the anxious wrinkle on his brow, and the heat of the hand which grasped
      Védrine&rsquo;s, all betrayed his subjection to one absorbing passion, one fixed
      idea. But the meeting with Védrine seemed to have relieved his nerves, and
      he asked affectionately, &lsquo;Well, what are you doing, and how are you
      getting on? How is your wife? And the children?&rsquo; His friend answered with
      his quiet smile. All were doing well, thank God. The little girl was just
      going to be weaned. The boy continued to fulfil his function of looking
      lovely, and was waiting impatiently for old Réhu&rsquo;s centenary. As for
      himself, he was hard at work. He had two pictures in the Salon this year,
      not badly hung, and not badly sold. On the other hand a creditor, not less
      unwise than hard, had taken possession of the Knight, and he had passed
      from stage to stage, first lying much in the way in a fine suite of rooms
      on the ground floor in the Rue St. Pétersbourg, then packed off to a
      stable at Batignolles, and now shivering under a cowkeeper&rsquo;s shed at
      Levallois, where from time to time the sculptor and his family went to pay
      him a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So much for glory!&rsquo; added Védrine with a laugh, as the voice of the usher
      called for the witness Astier-Réhu. The head of the Permanent Secretary
      showed for a moment, outlined against the dusty light of the court-room,
      upright and steady; but his back he had forgotten to control, and the
      shiver of his broad shoulders betrayed intense feeling. &lsquo;Poor man,&rsquo; 
      muttered the sculptor, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got heavy trials to go through. This
      autograph business, and his son&rsquo;s marriage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Paul Astier married?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, three days ago, to the Duchess Padovani. It was a sort of morganatic
      marriage, with no guests but the young man&rsquo;s mamma and the four witnesses.
      I was one of them, as you may suppose, for a freak of fate seems to
      associate me with all the acts and deeds of the Astier family.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Védrine described the sorrowful surprise with which in the Mayor&rsquo;s
      room he had seen the Duchess Padovani appear, deathly pale, as haughty as
      ever, but withered and heart-broken, with a mass of grey hair, the poor
      beautiful hair that she no longer took the trouble to dye. By her side was
      Paul Astier, the Count, smiling, cold, and charming as before. They all
      looked at one another, and nobody had a word to say except the official
      who, after a good stare at the two old ladies, felt it incumbent upon him
      to remark with a gracious bow:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are only waiting for the bride.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The bride is here,&rsquo; replied the Duchess, stepping forward with head erect
      and a bitter smile which spoilt and twisted her beautiful mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Mayor&rsquo;s office, where the deputy on duty had the good taste to
      spare them an oration, they adjourned to the Catholic Institute in the Rue
      de Vaugirard, an aristocratic church, all over gilding and flowers and a
      blaze of candles, but not a soul there, nobody but the wedding party on a
      single row of chairs, to hear the Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Adriani, mumble
      an interminable homily out of an illuminated book. A fine thing it was, to
      hear the worldly prelate with large nose, thin lips, and hollow shoulders
      under his violet cape, talking of the &lsquo;honourable traditions of the
      husband and the charms of the wife,&rsquo; with a sombre, cynical side-glance at
      the velvet cushions of the unhappy couple. Then came the departure; cold
      good-byes were exchanged under the arches of the little cloister, and a
      sigh of relief with &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s over,&rsquo; escaped the Duchess, said in the
      despairing, disenchanted accent of a woman who has measured the abyss, and
      leaps in with her eyes open only to keep her word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, well,&rsquo; Védrine went on, &lsquo;I have seen gloomy and lamentable sights
      enough in the course of my lite, but never anything so heart-breaking as
      Paul Astier&rsquo;s wedding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a fine rascal, though, is our young friend,&rsquo; said Freydet, between
      his closed teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, a precious product of the &ldquo;struggle for existence.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The sculptor repeated the phrase with emphasis. A &lsquo;struggler for
      existence&rsquo; was his name for the novel tribe of young savages who cite the
      necessity of &lsquo;nature&rsquo;s war&rsquo; as an hypocritical excuse for every kind of
      meanness. Freydet went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, anyhow, he&rsquo;s rich now, which is what he wanted. His nose has not
      led him astray this time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait and see. The Duchess is not easy to get on with, and he looked
      devilish wicked at the Mayor&rsquo;s. If the old lady bores him too much, we may
      still see him some day at the Assize Court, son and grandson of divinities
      as he is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The witness Védrine!&rsquo; called the usher at the top of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment a huge roar of laughter ran over the thronging crowd
      and came through the door as it swung open. &lsquo;They don&rsquo;t seem bored in
      there,&rsquo; said the municipal officer posted in the passage. The witnesses&rsquo; 
      room, which had been gradually emptying during the chat of the two
      schoolfellows, now contained only Freydet and the caretaker, who, scared
      at having to appear in court, was twisting the strings of her cap like a
      lunatic. The worthy candidate, on the contrary, thought he had an
      unparalleled opportunity of burning incense at the shrine of the Académie
      Française and its Permanent Secretary. Left alone, when the good woman&rsquo;s
      turn came, he paced up and down the room, planted himself in front of the
      window, and let off well-rounded periods accompanied by magnificent
      gestures of his black gloves. But he was misunderstood in the house
      opposite; and a fat hand at the end of a bare arm pulled aside a pink
      curtain and waved to him. Freydet, flushing crimson with shame, moved
      quickly away from the window, and took refuge in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Public Prosecutor is speaking now,&rsquo; said the doorkeeper in a whisper,
      as a voice in a tone of assumed indignation rang through the heated air of
      the court&mdash;&lsquo;You played,&rsquo; it said, &lsquo;on the innocent passion of an old
      man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how about me?&rsquo; said Freydet, thinking aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I expect you have been forgotten.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Freydet was at first puzzled, but presently disgusted at the strange fate
      which prevented his coming forward in public as the champion of the
      Académie, and so getting himself talked about and seeing his name for once
      in the papers. Just then a shout of laughter greeted the enumeration of
      the forgeries in the Mesnil-Case collection; letters from kings, popes,
      empresses, Turenne, Buffon, Montaigne, La Boëtie, Clémence Isaure, and the
      mere mention of the absurd list showed the extraordinary simplicity of the
      historian who had been befooled by the little dwarf. But at the thought
      that this disrespectful laugh was a scoff at his master and protector,
      Freydet felt an indignation not altogether free from selfishness. He felt
      that he was himself hit by the recoil, and his candidature damaged again.
      He broke away, mingling in the stir of the general exodus amid a confusion
      of footmen running to and fro in the beautiful waning light of a fine June
      day, while the parasols, pink, white, mauve, or green opened like so many
      large flowers. Little explosions of laughter were still coming from the
      various groups, as if they had been seeing an amusing piece at the
      theatre. The little humpback had got it hot&mdash;five years&rsquo; imprisonment
      and costs. But how comic Margery had been! Marguerite Oger was exclaiming
      in fits, &lsquo;Oh my dears, my dears!&rsquo; and Danjou, escorting Madame Eviza to
      her carriage, said aloud in his cynical way, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a slap in the face for
      the Académie, well planted&mdash;but it was cleverly done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Léonard Astier, who was walking alone, heard Danjou&rsquo;s remark as well as
      others, in spite of the warnings passed from mouth to mouth, &lsquo;Take care&mdash;there
      he is.&rsquo; It signified to him the beginning of his fall in estimation,
      consequent on the general knowledge of his folly and the amusement of
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take my arm, my dear master!&rsquo; said Freydet, who had been carried to him
      by the strong impulse of affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, my dear friend, how much good you do me!&rsquo; said the old man in a dull,
      broken voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on in silence for some time. The trees on the quay cast a
      tracery of shade upon the stones below; the sounds of the street and the
      river echoed in the joyous air. It was one of those days on which human
      wretchedness seems to have been reprieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are we going?&rsquo; asked Freydet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anywhere&mdash;except home,&rsquo; answered the elder man, who felt a child&rsquo;s
      terror at the thought of the scene his wife would inflict on him at
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      They dined together at the Point-du-Jour after walking a long time by the
      river. When poor Astier returned home very late the friendly words of his
      old pupil and the sweetness of the air had succeeded in restoring his
      peace of mind. He had got over his five hours in the stocks on the bench
      of the Eighth Chamber&mdash;five hours to endure with bound hands the
      insulting laughter of the crowd and the vitriol squirt of the counsel.
      &lsquo;Laugh, apes, laugh! Posterity will judge!&rsquo; was the thought with which he
      consoled himself as he crossed the large courts of the Institute, wrapped
      in slumber, with unlighted windows and great dark foursquare holes right
      and left where the staircases came down. He felt his way upstairs and
      reached his study noiselessly like a thief. Since Paul&rsquo;s marriage and his
      quarrel with his son he was in the habit of flinging himself down every
      night on a bed made up in the study, to escape the interminable midnight
      discussions in which the wife always comes off victorious, thanks to the
      never-failing support of her &lsquo;nerves&rsquo;, and the husband ends by giving way
      and promising everything for the sake of peace and permission to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleep! Never had he so much felt the need of it as now, at the end of his
      long day of emotion and fatigue, and the darkness of his study as he
      entered seemed the beginning of rest&mdash;when in the angle of the window
      he dimly distinguished a human figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I hope you are satisfied.&rsquo; It was his wife! She was on the look out
      for him, waiting, and her angry voice stopped him short in the dark to
      listen. &lsquo;You have won your cause; you insisted on making yourself a
      mockery, and you have done it&mdash;daubed and drenched yourself with
      ridicule, till you won&rsquo;t be able to show yourself again! Much reason you
      had to cry out that your son was disgracing you, to insult and to curse
      your son! Poor boy, it is well he has changed his name, now that yours has
      become so identified with ignorance and gullibility that no one will be
      able to utter it without a smile. And all this, if you please, for the
      sake of your historical work! Why, you foolish man, who knows anything
      about your historical work? Who can possibly care whether your documents
      are genuine or forged? You know that nobody reads you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on and on, pouring out a thin stream of voice in her shrillest
      tone; and he felt as if he were back again in the pillory, listening to
      the official abuse as he had done all day, without interrupting, without
      even a threatening gesture, swallowing the insults as he had in court, and
      feeling that the authority was above attack and the judge one not to be
      answered. But how cruel was this invisible mouth which bit him, and
      wounded him all over, and slowly mangled in its teeth his pride as a man
      and a writer!
    </p>
    <p>
      His books, indeed! Did he suppose that they had got him into the Académie?
      Why, it was to his wife alone that he owed his green coat! She had spent
      her life in plotting and manoeuvring to break open one door after another;
      sacrificed all her youth to such intrigues, and such intriguers, as made
      her sick with disgust. &lsquo;Why, my dear, I had to! The Académie is attained
      by talent, of which you have none, or a great name, or a high position.
      You had none of these things. So I came to the rescue.&rsquo; And that there
      might be no mistake about it, that he might not attribute what she said
      only to the exasperation of a woman wounded and humiliated in her wifely
      pride and her blind maternal devotion, she recalled the details of his
      election, and reminded him of his famous remark about Madame Astier&rsquo;s
      veils that smelt of tobacco, though he never smoked, &lsquo;a remark, my dear,
      that has done more to make you notorious than your books.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a low deep groan, the stifled cry of a man who stays with both
      hands the life escaping from a mortal rent The sharp little voice went on
      unaltered. &lsquo;Ah well, pack your trunk, do, once for all! Let the world hear
      no more of you. Fortunately your son is rich and will give you your daily
      bread. For you need not be told that now you will find no publisher or
      magazine to take your rubbish, and it will be due to Paul&rsquo;s supposed
      infamy that you escape starvation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is more than I can bear,&rsquo; muttered the poor man as he fled away,
      away from the lashing fury. And as he felt his way along the walls, and
      passed through the passage, down the stairs, across the echoing court, he
      muttered almost in tears, &lsquo;More than I can bear, more than I can bear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whither is he going? Straight before him, as if in a dream. He crosses the
      square and is half over the bridge, before the fresh air revives him. He
      sits down on a bench, takes off his hat and pulls up his coat sleeves to
      still the beating of his pulses; and the regular lapping of the water
      makes him calmer. He comes to himself again, but consciousness brings only
      memory and pain. What a woman! what a monster! And to think that he has
      lived five-and-thirty years with her and not known her! A shudder of
      disgust runs over him at the recollection of all the horrors he has just
      heard. She has spared nothing and left within him nothing alive, not even
      the pride which still kept him erect, his faith in his work and his belief
      in the Académie. At the thought of the Académie he instinctively turned
      round. Beyond the deserted bridge, beyond the wider avenue which leads to
      the foot of the building, the pile of the Palais Mazarin, massed together
      in the darkness, up-reared its portico and its dome, as on the cover of
      the Didot books, so often gazed upon in his young days and in the
      ambitious aspirations of his whole life. That dome, that block of stone,
      had been the delusive object of his hopes, and the cause of all his
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was there he sought his wife, feeling neither love nor delight, but for
      the hope of the Institute. And he has had the coveted seat, and he knows
      the price!
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then there was a sound of steps and laughter on the bridge; it came
      nearer. Some students with their mistresses were coming back to their
      rooms. Afraid of being recognised, he rose and leant over the parapet; and
      while the party passed close to him without seeing him, he reflected with
      bitterness that he had never amused himself, never allowed himself such a
      fine night&rsquo;s holiday of song beneath the starlight. His ambition had
      always been fixed unbendingly on the approach to yonder dome, the dome, as
      it were, of a temple, whose beliefs and whose ritual he had respected in
      anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what had yonder dome given him in return? Nothing, absolutely nothing.
      Even on the day of his admission, when the speeches were over and the
      double-edged compliments at an end, he had felt the sensation of emptiness
      and deluded hope. He had said to himself as he drove home to change his
      green coat, &lsquo;Have I really got in? Why, it can&rsquo;t be like this.&rsquo; Since
      then, by dint of constant lying to himself and echoing, with his
      colleagues, that it was delightful, delicious, he had ended by believing
      so. But now the veil had fallen away, and he saw the truth; and he would
      have liked to proclaim with a thousand tongues to the youth of France,
      &lsquo;The Académie is a snare and a delusion. Go your way and do your work.
      Sacrifice nothing to the Académie, for it has nothing to offer you,
      neither gift, nor glory, nor the best thing of all, self-contentment. It
      is neither a retreat nor a refuge; it is a hollow idol, a religion that
      offers no consolations. The great troubles of life come upon you there as
      elsewhere; under that dome men have killed themselves, men have gone mad
      there! Those who in their agony have turned to the Académie, and weary of
      loving, or weary of cursing, have stretched forth their arms to her, have
      clasped but a shadow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old schoolmaster was speaking aloud, bareheaded, grasping the parapet
      with both hands as in old days he used to hold the edge of his desk at
      lessons. The river rolled on below, tinged with hues of night, between its
      rows of winking lamps. An uncanny thing is the speechless life of light,
      moving, and looking, and never saying what it means. On the quay the song
      of a drunken man died quavering away in the distance, &lsquo;When Cupid... in
      the morn... awakes.&rsquo; The accent showed that the merry singer was an
      Auvergnat making his way back to his coal-barge. It reminded him of
      Teyssèdre, the polisher, and his glass of good wine. He saw him wiping his
      mouth on his shirt-sleeve. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the only real good in life.&rsquo; Even a
      humble natural joy like that he had never known; he must needs envy even
      Teyssèdre. Absolutely alone, with no refuge, no breast on which to weep,
      he realised that &lsquo;that woman&rsquo; was right, and &lsquo;the trunk had better be
      packed for good and all, Léonard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning some policemen found on a bench on the Pont des Arts a
      wide-brimmed hat, one of those hats which preserve something of the
      expression of their owner. Inside was a large gold watch and a visiting
      card&mdash;&lsquo;Léonard Astier-Réhu, Permanent Secretary of the Académie
      Française.&rsquo; Right across the line of print had been written in pencil the
      words, &lsquo;I die here of my own will.&rsquo; Of his own will indeed it was! Even
      better than the little phrase in the large, firm handwriting did the
      expression of his features&mdash;the set teeth, the projection of the
      lower jaw&mdash;declare his fixed determination to die, when after a
      morning&rsquo;s search the dredgers found the body caught in the wide meshes of
      an iron net surrounding some baths for women, quite close to the bridge.

    <p>
      It was taken first to the emergency-station, where Picheral came to
      identify it, a strange sight himself, as he fluttered along the wide bank,
      with bare bald head and in a frock coat. It was not the first time that a
      Permanent Secretary had been taken out of the Seine; the same thing had
      occurred in the time of Picheral&rsquo;s father, under very similar
      circumstances. And Picheral the son did not seem much affected, only
      annoyed that he could not wait till the evening to carry Astier-Réhu home.
      But it was necessary to take advantage of the absence of Madame Astier
      (who was breakfasting with her son) so as to spare her too great a shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock of the Palais Mazarin was striking one, when with the heavy
      tramp of the bearers the stretcher from the station was brought under the
      archway, marking its road with ominous splashes of water. At the foot of
      Staircase B there was a halt to take breath. Over the dazzling court was a
      great sharp-lined square of blue sky. The covering of the stretcher had
      been raised, and the features of Léonard Astier-Réhu were visible for the
      last time to his colleagues on the Dictionary Committee, who had just
      broken up their meeting in sign of mourning. They stood round, with their
      hats off, not a little shocked. Other people also stopped to see what it
      was, workmen, clerks, and apprentices, for the Institute serves as a
      passage from the Rue Mazarin to the quay. Among them was kind-hearted
      Freydet, who, as he wiped his eyes, thought in his heart, and was ashamed
      to think it, that here was another vacancy. Old Jean Réhu was just coming
      downstairs for his daily constitutional.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had heard nothing, seemed surprised to see the crowd beneath him as he
      stood on one of the lower steps, and came nearer to look, in spite of the
      scared gestures of those who tried to keep him back. Did he understand?
      Did he recognise the corpse? His face remained calm, so did his eyes, as
      expressionless as those of the bust of Minerva under her helmet of bronze.
      And after a long look, as they turned the striped canvas down over the
      poor dead face, he went on, upright and proud, with his tall shadow
      stalking beside him, a &lsquo;deity&rsquo; deathless indeed, while a half-mad senile
      shake of the head seemed to say: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s another of the things I have
      seen.&rsquo;
